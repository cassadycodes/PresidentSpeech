##### Future directions for research
- Run keyword analysis with stemmer / lemmas instead. 
- NLTK's tokenizer is throwing away "coronavirus"!!! Fix.
- Check bigrams with "virus" - expect to see fight_virus, China_virus etc.
- Remember why text += text is poor programming, improve efficiency.
- Hyuge Task: Complete BIGLY version of Trump corpus. Fine tune get_text.py and collect entirety of Trump White House Archive.
