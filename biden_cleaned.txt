       2:30 P.M. The progress we have made on vaccinating this country is a great American story.  The federal government has stepped up, taken responsibility, and launched a massive federal vaccination program.  Governors and mayors of both political parties — Republicans and Democrats — have stepped up as well.  Our military, our National Guard, You’ve heard me say it many times before: Our progress on vaccination is a stunning example that there is nothing — nothing this country cannot do if we put our minds to it and we do it together.   But as I’ve also said, We share the sentiment of Dr. Walensky, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The You know, as many people as we have vaccinated, we still have more Americans left to go.  You know, we will administer more shots in March than any country on Earth.  But even so, we have to give more shots in April than we did in March.  Because we’re in the life and death race for the virus that is spreading quickly with cases rising again.  New variants are spreading.  And sadly, some of the reckless behavior we’ve seen on television over the past few weeks means that more new cases are to come in the weeks ahead.  With vaccines, there’s hope, which is a — which is a very good thing, to state the obvious.  But people are let — are letting up on precautions, which is a very bad thing.  Look, to this point, cases have fallen two thirds since So, let me start here: First, this week, thanks to my administration’s intensive work with vaccine manufacturers and distribution efforts, the amount of vaccines that are going to be available for vaccinators — vaccination sites will be a new record: 33 million doses of vaccine this week.   By getting more vaccine supply to states, community health centers, and pharmacies, we can vaccinate the highest-risk Americans more quickly than we already are.  And then — and then we make it possible to open up supplies for all adults and to try to beat the renewed spread of this virus.  As a result, I’m also pleased to announce that we’re on track this week — just 10 weeks after And with the supply we’re releasing this week — just this week alone — there are more doors [sic] — there are more doses of vaccine available for seniors this week than any week thus far.  So, seniors, please, if you have not gotten your shot yet, get it this week.  Get it.  Second, I’m reiterating my call for every governor, mayor, and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mask mandate.  Please, this is not politics.  Reinstate the mandate if you let it down.  And business should require masks as well.  The failure to take this virus seriously — precisely what got us in this mess in the first place — risks more cases and more dests [sic] — deaths.  Look, as Third, And So to make it easier for Americans to get vaccinated as the supply grows and vaccination eligibility expands, I’m directing my Look, we’re going to do this by growing from having 17,000 pharmacies giving out vaccination shots to nearly 40,000 pharmacies doing it within the next three weeks.  That will more than double the number of pharmacies where you can go get vaccinated.  But we aren’t stopping there.   In the next three weeks, we’ll add 12 more federally run mass vaccination sites.  Every day at these sites, tens of thousands of people are able to drive up, get a vaccine shot while in their car, and leave in less than an hour.  And over 60 percent of the shots given at these sites goes to minority communities because they’re in minority communities.  We have to reach out.  They’re the ones most affected by the vacci- — by both the vaccine, but also by the pandemic.  We’re also going to send more aid to states to expand the opening of more community vaccination sites — more vaccines, more sites, more vaccinators — all designed to speed our critical work.   But we also need to make it easier for those who want shots but cannot access vaccination sites to get vaccinated.  This is also where we’re focused on the seniors most immediately.  While we have made incredible progress in starting to vaccinate nearly three quarters of our seniors and now putting vaccination sites within 5 miles of 90 percent of all Americans, that still isn’t enough as far as we’re concerned.  We know that there are a number of seniors and people with disabilities who may be isolated and have lack of access to transportation, and there are community groups that can help.  They’re trying to help now.  So, our fourth announcement today is that I’m sending out millions of dollars, through the Department of Health and Human Service, to provide assistance, including transportation, so more vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities can get their shots because they get help to physically get there, to get the shot.  Neighbors helping neighbors: What a truly American effort.  We cannot let transportation be a barrier to any senior getting a vaccination.   And so where does this put us?  We’re making progress on vaccinations, but cases are rising and the virus is spreading in too many places still.   That’s why, today, I’m taking these steps to make our American turnaround story a vac- — our vaccination program — move even faster.  Thanks to all the work we’ve done these past 10 weeks, the added steps I’m announcing today — with them — I’m pleased to announce that at least 90 percent of all adults in this country will be eligible to be vaccinated by April the 19th, just three weeks from now, because we have the vaccines.   For the vast, vast majority of adults, you won’t have to wait until May 1.  You’ll be eligible for your shot on April 19th.  Finally, 10 percent will be eligible no later than — the final 10 percent will be eligible no later than May 1.   And as  So we’re moving toward “90/90” by April 19th.  That is, by April 19, three weeks from today, 90 percent of adults — people over 18 and over — will be eligible get vaccinated.  Ninety percent of all Americans will be living within five miles of a place they can get a shot.   And, of course, it will take time for everyone to get their appointment.  It’s a big country.  And as fast as we’re going, and we still have a long way to go to finish this vaccination effort.  In fact, we aren’t even there — we aren’t halfway yet.  But being at 90/90 just three weeks from today should give hope to the country.   Let me close with this: The progress we’re making is a significant testament to what we can do when we work together as Americans.  But as I’ve always said, we still need everyone to do their part.   We still are in a war with this deadly virus.  And we’re bolstering our defenses, but this war is far from won.   Together, we have so much to be proud of in the past 3 weeks — past more than 3 weeks; past 10 weeks.   We also have so much to be sorrowful about.  Nearly 1,000 Americans a day are still dying from COVID-19 as we approach 550,000 deaths in a single year.   Until this country is vaccinated, each of us has to do our part.  We have an obligation — a patriotic obligation: Wash your hands, stay socially distanced, wear a mask as recommended by the CDC, and get vaccinated.  Get your friends and family vaccinated when you can help.   Now is not the time to let down.  Now is not the time to celebrate.  It is time to do what we do best as a country: our duty, our jobs; take care of one another; and fight this to the finish.   We can and will do this, but don’t let up now.  Don’t let up now.   Thank you.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you very much.          Yes.  2:44 P.M.        New Castle, Delaware  4:12 P.M.        It’s terrible.  It’s absolutely outrageous.  And based on the reporting I’ve gotten, an awful lot of people have been killed totally unnecessarily.     Sure,     Close.     Close.      Well, based on what I’m hearing, apparently people are letting their guard down.  But         Ice cream.     Well, we’re working on that now.     We are putting in place a plan that  Thank you.      Been concerned about that for years.  4:14 P.M.        Wilmington, Delaware    5:37 P.M.   But maybe the person  Well, when Keisha’s mom said she believed in me,  And we need her, and Atlanta needs her.  You know, we saw it just weeks after — just weeks after we found ourselves  to the mass shooting.  When the Vice Pres- — when  And we’ve seen her leadership during this pandemic — believing in science and leading a city that’s home to a tremendous public servant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the CDC.   We saw her stand tall and speak out during the summer of protests and pain.  And during the campaign that tested our very democracy, she was always there.  So many of you stepped up as well.   And if anyone ever doubted that voting matters, Georgia just proved that it did.  If anyone ever wondered if one vote can make a difference, Georgia proved it 11,779 times.  And if anyone ever wondered if voting can change a country, Georgia just proved that.  And if you’re wondering whether Republican officials will finally stop their attacks on the right to vote and actually try and win over votes, they just proved yesterday they won’t.  It’s  America and what they’re doing — that it cannot stand  So, above all, Keisha knows democracy is not just about winning elections.  It’s about governing, making government work.  It’s about making government work for working families, for the people who are — who are the backbone of this country.  And that’s why we fought so hard to pass the American Rescue Plan.  It’s making a difference.  Just last week, we passed 100 million shots in arms in the first 58 days in office.  We’re going to get  200 million in my first 100 days.  That includes a $10 billion investment to make sure we reach the hardest-hit and highest- risk communities.  And, yesterday, we reached 100 million checks for $1,400 into people’s pockets and their bank accounts.  By the time this money is distributed, 88 percent of all adults and children in Georgia will receive such a check.  That’s going to change their lives.  The American Rescue Plan will cut child poverty literally in half, including for 171,000 Georgia children.  It provides $4 billion for Georgia’s schoolchildren, in grades  And one of the biggest things for Georgia and the Atlantic — and Atlanta: Georgia is now eligible for about $2 billion in expanded Medicaid.  That means another 500,000 Georgians will be covered all across the state with Medicaid that they don’t have right now.  And that’s on top of the lower premiums and expanded coverage, if you have a plan through Obamacare.   Your state — the state of Georgia — will also get around $5 billion to make up for the lost revenues.  Local governments will get around $3.5 billion.  That’s going to make it possible to keep police officers, firefighters, teachers, first responders on the job, rather than have to lay them off because of a lack of funding.  And who is going to deliver this help on the ground?  The Mayor.  The Mayor.  But that’s just the beginning.  And as we rescue the economy in the coming weeks, I’ll be laying out my vision for a Build Back Better plan to rebuild America’s own 21st century, modernizing our infrastructure — our transportation systems, our broadband systems, our water and power systems.  And we’re going to make historic investments in research and development, and we’re going to create millions — and it’s not just me; it’s not just a Democratic think tank.  Wall Street has pointed out millions of good-paying jobs here in America — manufacturing, clean energy, and so much more.  Just manufacturing in general.   We’re also going to invest in our families, making  housing more affordable, and caregiving economy stronger for millions of Americans, mostly women and women of color who care for children and aging loved ones.  And they deserve to be paid well.  All this is going to help us outcompete the rest of the world, and it will depend on government being able to work for the American people.  That’s why  I’m going to close with this — I’ve kept you too long already: There is so much we can do if we do it together, if we stand together; if we once again believe and invest in science; if we stand up for justice and equality and the right of Americans to vote and have access to voting.   And Keisha is leading our efforts as Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee.  You have to remember, we’re here to help all the people of this country, the bottom up and the middle out, not just those in the top few.  Folks, if we do that, then there’s not a single solitary thing we can’t do if we do it together.   So to Keisha and to all of you,  And  So, Keisha,  5:44 P.M.        Wilmington, Delaware    Do   No — no,   Well, we talked a lot about climate change.  We talked a lot about the need also for Britain and the United States to — to stand together and deal with the whole notion of whether or not   Well, there was full agreement.  One of the things     It’s really great.    Not — not as strong as   Well, we’re working on that right now.  We don’t know quite exactly what we can do at this point.  The Justice Department is taking a look as well.    Well, look, we’ll see.  The question is whether or not — you know, you have to have 50 votes — 51 votes to have to win to be able to move the filibuster and any change in the filibuster.  And right now, that doesn’t exist.  That doesn’t exist.  So, you know, look,   Pardon me?    Well, we’re looking at that right now.  We’re looking at what kind of authority   We have equipment and capacity that most countries don’t have, and we’re seeing what we can do — what help we can be.  Thank you.          2:59 P.M.         Say again?     It’s an atrocity.  The idea — if you want any indication that it has nothing to do with fairness, nothing to do with decency — they passed a law saying you can’t provide water for people standing in line while they’re waiting to vote.  You don’t need anything else to know that this is nothing but punitive design to keep people from voting.  You can’t provide water for people about to vote?  Give me a break.   3:00 P.M.         Yet instead of celebrating the rights of all Georgians to vote or winning campaigns on the merits of their ideas, Republicans in the state instead rushed through an un-American law to deny people the right to vote. This law, like so many others being pursued by Republicans in statehouses across the country is a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience. Among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over. It adds rigid restrictions on casting absentee ballots that will effectively deny the right to vote to countless voters. And it makes it a crime to provide water to voters while they wait in line – lines Republican officials themselves have created by reducing the number of polling sites across the state, disproportionately in Black neighborhoods.  This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end. We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act.  And  If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people vote.  ###           1:27 P.M. First, on vaccinations: On December 8th, Now, today, I’m setting a second goal, and that is: We will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people’s arms. That’s right: 200 million shots in 100 days.  And today, we’ve made a historic investment in reaching the hardest-hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest-risk communities — as a consequence of the virus — by investing an addition $10 billion in being able to reach them.  As of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people’s bank accounts. That’s real money in people’s pockets, bringing relief instantly, almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon.  One final note: Since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we’re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. Since it was passed, a majority — a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that’s going to take place this year. They’re now projecting it will exceed 6 percent — a 6 percent growth in GDP.  And just this morning, we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. That’s the first time in a year the number has fallen below the pre-pandemic high.  So there are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and we still have a lot of work to do.  But Now I’ll be happy to take your questions.  Zeke, the Associated Press.   Well, I’m going to — look, when And the other problems we’re talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they’ve been around a long time. And what we’re going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and — whether it’s immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.  But the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they’re going to lose a family member, whether they’re going to be in a position where they’re not going to be — they’re going to lose their home because they can’t pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to — to pay their rent.  So we’re going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that’s the reason why And here’s the deal:  Well, So let’s see what happens. All Okay. How about Yamiche?  How do you resolve that tension? And how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go, given the fact that even though, with Title 42, there are some families that are staying? And is there a timeline for when we won’t be seeing these overcrowded facilities with — run by  Well, look, The truth of the matter is: Nothing has changed. As many people came — 28 percent increase in children to the border in my administration; 31 percent in the last year of — in 2019, before the pandemic, in the Trump administration. It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year.  In addition to that, there is a — and nobody — and, by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31 percent increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? That’s not the reason they’re coming.  The reason they’re coming is that it’s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. Number two, they’re coming because of the circumstances in-country — in-country.  The way to deal with this problem — and What did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn’t use it. He didn’t do it. And in addition to that, what he did — he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and — and has been — continued to be a problem for a long time. He, in fact, shut down the — the number of beds available. He did not fund And so what we’re doing now is attempting to rebuild — rebuild the system that can accommodate the — what is happening today. And Let me say one other thing on this. If you take a look at the number of people who are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back — are being sent back. Thousands — tens of thousands of people who are — who are over 18 years of age and single — people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home.  We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We’re trying to work out now, with Mexico, their willingness to take more of those families back. But we — that’s what’s happening. They’re not getting across the border.  And those who are coming across the border, who are unaccompanied children, we’re moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as So what we’re doing is we’re providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities, which no child — no one should be in any longer than 72 hours.  And today, So we’re building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It’s going to take time.  And the other thing we’re doing,  No, no, but And in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, there’s — immigration is a big issue, of course, when it — related to the filibuster, but there’s also Republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer is calling it an “existential threat” to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration?  Jim Clyburn, someone who — of course, who you know very well, has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rights.   Well, look, I’m going to deal with all of those problems. The question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate.  Let’s go to the first question you asked — the first of the second question you asked. And that is: What about dealing with families? Why are not — some not going back? Because Mexico is refusing to take them back. They’re saying they won’t take them back — not all of them.  We’re in negotiations with the President of Mexico. And what we’re doing there, and it’s an important point to understand — What was happening before is it was taking literally weeks and weeks, and maybe even months, before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. Well, we’ve set up a system now where, within 24 hours, there’s a phone call made as that person or that child crosses the border. And then a verification system is being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called or that is actually a mom, a dad, and/or a close relative. They’re establishing that right off the bat.  If it, in fact, is Mom or Dad, Dad says — to take the extreme case — “And so that’s going to reduce significantly — there’s two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a Border Patrol station. One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be held. The second way to do it is put them in a Health and Human Services facility that we’re occupying now — both licensed beds around the country that exist, as well as, for example, federal resources like Fort Bliss — to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while their fate is determined.   Filibuster. Filibuster. You know, with regard to the filibuster, And, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote.  So But here’s the deal: As you observed, I’m a fairly practical guy. And so, I’m going to say something outrageous: Okay. Hang on. Sorry. Oh, Seung Min — Ms. Kim.    If we could end it with 51, we would have no problem. You’re going to have to — the existing rule — it’s going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster.  But it’s not my expertise, in what the parliamentary rules and how to get there are. But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate, but in the meantime, we got a lot we can do while we’re talking about what we’re going to do about the filibuster.  Let me get here. Okay, Cecilia Vega.     Astounding.  So, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging — in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process — encouraging families like Yossell says to come?   Well, look, the idea that I’m going to say — which That’s why I’ve asked the Vice President of the United States, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in the first place. It’s because of earthquakes, floods. It’s because of lack of food. It’s because of gang violence. It’s because of a whole range of things.  That — when Well, what When this hurricane occurred — two hurricanes — instead of us going down and helping in a major way, so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn’t have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. We’re going to do a lot in our administration. We’re going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place.  That mother did not sit around with — on the kitchen table and say, “You know,  What a desperate act to have to take. The circumstances must be horrible. So we can do something about that. That’s what the Vice President is going to be doing: what And so, the question here is whether — how we go ahead and do this; what we do. There’s no easy answer   Well, the judgment has to be made whether or not — and in this young man’s case, he has a mom at home; there’s an overwhelming reason why he’d be put in a plane and flown back to his mom.   Yep.   Is — that’s a serious question, right?  Is it acceptable to me? Come on. That’s why we’re going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly. That’s why That is totally unacceptable.  Ken.   The answer is that it’s going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, it’s hard to get those troops out. So, what we’ve been doing — what I’ve been doing and what Secretary Blinken has been doing — has been — we’ve been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have We’re in consultation, And General Austin is — just met with Kayani [Ghani] and I’m waiting for the briefing on that. He is the — the “leader,” quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul. And there’s a U.N.-led process that’s beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people — how to end this war.  But it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is: How and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it’s not being able to be worked out to begin with? How is that done? But we are not staying a long time.   We will leave. The question is when we leave.   Okay. Kristen.    And one of the reasons   To roll back what? I’m sorry.   First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all — did not slow up the amount of immigration — and there’s many people coming.  And rolling back the policies of separating children from — from their mothers,  Let me say that, number one, U.N. Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested — number one. We’re consulting with our allies and partners. And there will be responses — if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly.  But I’m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. So that’s what we’re doing right now: consulting with our allies.   You’ve only got another hour now, okay?   Yes.  Okay. Hang on a second here, Kristen. Nancy, CBS.  Are you worried that if you don’t manage to pass voting rights legislation that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the House and the Senate in 2022?   What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line, waiting to vote; deciding that you’re going to end voting at five o’clock when working people are just getting off work; deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances.  It’s all designed — and I’m going to spend my time doing three things: One, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House, number one. Number two, educating the American public. The Republican voters And so I’m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from — from becoming the law.   The answer is “yes,” but I’m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now.    My predecessor need do [sic] — needed to. My predecessor. Oh God,  No, the answer is “yes.” My plan is to run for reelection. That’s my expectation.   No, But, look, And so, unless Mitch says the last thing Okay. Where am  That counts as a question, but go ahead.   No, no — you can.   Yes.   Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let’s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It’s been abused from the time it came into being — by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let’s deal with the abuse first.     Look,  It —    Oh, come on. If you notice — don’t you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about that the cost and the taxes that had to be had — if there is any tax to be had, as they talk about it — in dealing with the — the act that we just passed which puts money in people’s pockets — ordinary people.  Did you hear them complain when they passed close to a $2 trillion Trump tax cut — 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Did you hear them talk about that all? When the federal budget is saving people’s lives, they don’t think it’s such a good idea. When the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans — 90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars not paying a cent in taxes; reducing taxes to the point that people who are making — you know, if you’re a husband and wife, a schoolteacher and a cop, you’re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is — something is wrong. Their newfound concern.  I’m concerned — look, So, from my perspective, you know, it’s a — to me, it’s about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people — just hardworking people. People get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able have a little bit of breathing room, being able to have — make sure that they go to bed not staring at the ceiling, like my dad, wondering whether — since he didn’t have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. These are basic things. Basic things.  And I’m of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered Republicans, by and large, share that — that same — that same view, that same sense of what is — you know, what’s appropriate.  Justin. Justin Sink, Bloomberg.  So, today, I’m wondering: Are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China? Are you considering banning imports of forced-labor products? And would you consider cutting off U.S. investment or Chinese access to international payment systems?   Well, look, they’re each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about.  I’ve known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly, by the time So, So, when And we made several things clear to one another. Two, that we’ll have strong competition but we’ll insist that China play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.  Thirdly, in order to compete effectively, The future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. And so what I’m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent.  One of the reasons why I’ve set up the — the The third — the second thing we’re going to do is we’re going to reestablish our alliances. And I’ve been very clear with him, it’s not anti-Chinese. And we’ve talked about it.  And earlier this month — and apparently it got the Chinese’s attention; that’s not why Before too long, I’m going to have — I’m going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we’re going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules — to follow the rules — whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea, or their agreement made on Taiwan, or a whole range of other things.  And the third thing, and the thing that  And he understood that.  That’s who we are. The moment a President walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. It’s who we are.  So    No, that’s not where  Look around the world. We’re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment? How will they do that? And are democracies equipped — because all the people get to speak — to compete?  It is clear, absolutely clear — and most of the scholars  If you notice, you don’t have Russia talking about communism anymore. It’s about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country — that’s what’s at stake here. We’ve got to prove democracy works.    All the above. It’s a matter of timing.  As you’ve all observed, successful presidents — better than me — have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they’re doing — order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done.  The next major initiative is — and I’ll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh, in detail — is to rebuild the infrastructure — both physical and technological infrastructure in this country — so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs. Really good-paying jobs.  And some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal and initiative.   Some of you, if you were ever local reporters, and you found your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community, what’s the first thing that businesses asked? “What’s the closest access to — access to an interstate highway? How far am  We have somewhere —  Bridges: More than one third of our bridges — 231,000 of them — need repairs. Some are physical safety risks or preservation work. One in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. That’s 186,000 miles of highway. Aviation: 20 percent of all flights — 20 percent of all flights weren’t on time, resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. Six to ten million homes in America still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. We have over 100,000 wellheads that are not capped, leaking methane.  What are we doing? And, by the way, we can put as many pipefitters and miners and — to work capping those wells at the same price that they would charge to dig those wells.  So, Last point I’ll make on the infrastructure — and The roads that used to be above the water level — didn’t have to worry about where the drainage ditch was — now you got to rebuild them three feet higher. Because it’s not going to go back to what it was before; it will only get worse, unless we stop it.  There’s so much we can do. Look at all of the schools in America. Most of you live in the Washington area now. But in your hometowns — So there’s so much we can do that’s good stuff, makes people healthier, and creates good jobs.  And  Well, they’re already getting better, but they’re going to get real — they’ll get a whole hell of lot better real quick, or we’re going to hear of some people leaving, okay?  We can get this done. We’re going to get it done.  But The next thing that has to happen though — as you well know has to happen — there have to be some certitude that this is the — actually mom, dad, or whomever. And there’s ways to do that. There’s ways to do that — a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card, you know? “What was your dog’s name?” kind of a thing. I’m being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data, from So,  Well, You know as well as When my great grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn’t want to leave. But they had no choice. So you got — we can’t — And the other thing And yesterday, But there’s no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can’t be made in the first 48 hours and begin.   No, because But, folks, I’m going. Thank you very, very much. 2:29 P.M.         5:09 P.M.   And both of you and your entire team — I’m not joking — have inspired our daughters and our granddaughters, who,   You know, you’re all heroes for so many people — and that’s not hyperbole to suggest that — on and off the field.  You know, and it matters that you lent your voice to the issues and the issue of fair pay and decency for so many years.    Megan, it’s hard to believe it was almost a year ago that we met virtually during the campaign.    And as Jill mentioned, seeing you win the World Cup back in 2015, that was an incredible moment for our family and our country.  And   And the reason we’re here today is because it’s Equal Pay Day, which has been around for 25 years.  It was declared 25 years ago — Equal Pay Day — though not enough people know about that and — and they — as they should.   You know, it’s a day that measures how much longer women typically have to work to match what men make in a single year.  That’s what Jill was talking about.  And it’s shocking when you look at the numbers.    Twelve years ago, when President Obama and   This year — that year,   Another way to look at it is, it took more than 15 months for a woman to earn the same amount that a man made in 12.  And more than three extra months — it’s more than that.  And it’s even longer for women of color.  And it’s wrong.    This year, Equal Pay Day falls in late March, which is a little bit better, but not much — from late April to late March.  And, frankly, we shouldn’t be satisfied until Equal Pay Day is no longer even necessary to mention at all.    The reality though is that in nearly every job — more than 90 percent of the occupations — women still earn less than men: 82 cents on the dollar on average.  For   It doesn’t matter if you’re an electrician, an accountant, or part of the best damn soccer team in the world, the pay gap is real.  And this team is living proof that you can be the very best at what you do and still have to fight for equal pay.   You know, as Jill mentioned, this pandemic has only exacerbated the problem.  Women are on the frontlines as essential workers, particularly women of color, in hospitals, grocery stores, childcare facilities, farms, factories, but they’re still earning less.    More than 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce since the pandemic started — 2 million.  And now we’re at the lowest rate of women participation in the labor force that we’ve been in more than 30 years.  Let me say it again: The lowest — the lowest percent of women in the workforce — had to go back 30 years to get to where we are today.     It undermines financial security.  And, by the way, it’s hard.    It undermines financial security for women and families.  It hurts our entire economy when we lose the talent and hard work of so many people.   In the American Rescue Plan you’ve heard so much about that we just passed, it was designed to address this core challenge.  It puts money directly into the pockets of people who need it the most: $1,400 checks for 85 percent of American households.  The hundredth million check has been deposited as of today, and many more are on the way.    It also expanded the Child Care Tax Credit. And here’s what that means, for those who don’t know: Right now, if you file for federal income tax, you get up to a $2,000 credit for each child.  But if you need help the most, if you’re making a minimum wage job and you don’t have to — you don’t make enough to pay federal income tax, then you don’t get this credit.    But because of the American Rescue Plan we passed, if you have two children under the age of six, for example, and you’re making $7.25 an hour — which is the minimum wage that so many people are making — you’ll get a check for $3,600 per child or $7,200.  Roughly, you get $500 a month mailed to you by the federal government.  That’s life-changing.    The American Rescue Plan is going to cut poverty across the board in America by about 31 percent.  And that’s a significant lift up for women.  The law provides $360 billion for funding state and local governments.  What that means is that’s going to prevent layoffs on jobs often held by women — nurses, teachers, healthcare workers, home healthcare aides — because the states have to balance their budget, because if they can’t — because of the lack of income coming in without the help from the federal government — they’ll have to lay off those essential workers.   And the law also includes $130 billion to reopen our schools safely; $40 billion for — invest in childcare investments; $160 billion to get the country vaccinated and beat this pandemic.  All this is going to give millions of women, including many moms and dads too, the freedom to rejoin the workforce and make the career choices that are best for them and their families.   But there’s so much more we need to do.  So much more.  We need the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act — the bill to remove loopholes in the law allowing employers to justify gender pay disparities.  It would help hold employers accountable for systemic pay discrimination.  It would help level the playing field for women and people of color by making it easier for workers to challenge the disparities as a group.  It would increase pay transparency.    By that,   Some employers may not allow you to know exactly, like   Too often, secrecy is part of the problem.  We know information is power.  You can’t solve the problem if you don’t know you’re not getting paid fairly.    My administration is going to fight for equal pay — for it to become a reality for all women.  It’s about justice.  It’s about fairness.  It’s about living up to our values and who we are as a nation.  Equal pay makes all of us stronger.   It’s not just women who care about this.  I’ve been around the country.  I’ve gone right into union halls and asked the men in the room, “How many of you — how would you feel if your wife or your sister didn’t earn the same amount of money as the man doing the same job next to you?”  And you hear them say — you hear them respond they don’t like it.  Why?  When your spouse or your sister is making the same amount of money the man she’s standing next is making, it means that when the hot water heater breaks, you can replace it.  You can get four new tires on the car.  It means everybody’s life is made better in that family.    Let me close with this: that to come out of this crisis and build back better, we need to erase the gender pay gap by ensuring that women have access to good-paying jobs; by raising wages for working folks and fighting for the right to organize and collectively bargain, because we know unions lift women’s wages even more than they lift men’s; and by investing our care — in our care infrastructure — our care infrastructure — in paid leave, childcare, homecare — so that people can care for their families and also go to work.    There’s a lot to do, but together we can ensure that our daughters have all the same rights and opportunities as our sons.  And if we’re able to do this, it’ll be transformational for our nation.  That’s the goal.  That’s what this is all about.  That’s what this team, all of you, are all about.   Let me make one more point.  You know, I’ve told my daughters, granddaughters from the time they got old enough to understand what     But this soccer team, America’s team, has done more to lift up people’s sense of who they can be, particularly young girls and women, above anything that’s been done.    So, as President of the United States,   As   And now it’s my great pleasure and honor — I’d like you to stand next to me, if you would, while   Thank you, folks.  I’m going to sign it now.  Come on over here.    The title of the proclamation is “National Equal Pay Day 2021.”     MS. RAPINOE:  I’m checking.  Just making sure it says what it says.       That’s what it says.    MS. RAPINOE:      Junior.     MS. RAPINOE:  Junior.  Junior.     My dad.  He was a fine man.    It says “Equal pay is a reminder of the work that still remains to advance equal — equality and ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to reach their full potential.”  Like you guys.       Thank you.    Thanks, everybody.     5:23 P.M.         2:14 P.M.   Thanks for being willing to do this, and But the Vice President and I, and all of us here, have been working very hard to — to pass the legislation that — that is going to beat this virus, as well as get people back to work and change their prospects.  And so, she’s traveling all over the country working that.  In addition to that, there’s about five other major things she’s handling, but I’ve asked her, the VP, today — because she’s the most qualified person to do it — to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that help — are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border.  And, you know, back when And the reason why so many people were leaving, we learned, was that not only gang violence and trafficking and cartels, but natural disasters, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes.  And so it’s not like someone sits around a hand-hewnen [sic] — hand-hewn table somewhere in Guatemala and says, “I’ve got a great idea:  Let’s sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, have him take our kids or us to the border of America, take us across, leave us in the desert.  We don’t speak the language.  Won’t that be fun?”  One of the ways we learned is that if you deal with the problems in country, it benefits everyone.  It benefits us, it benefits the people, and it grows the economies there.  Unfortunately, the last administration eliminated that funding — did not engage in it, did not use it — even though there was over $700 million to help get this done.  We’re reinstituting that program.  And there are — as But this is — this is the — the source of one of the reasons why we’ve had such a — before we took office, in the midst of the last administration’s somewhat draconian policies of separating children from their parents, et cetera, what happened was that we — we found that there were a serious spike in the number of people heading to the southern border, even in the midst of that.  And as — as Alejandro can tell you, is that was because there were serious natural disasters that occurred in those countries.  They were coming north, and we did nothing to do any — much about it.   So this new surge we’re dealing with now started with the last administration, but it’s our responsibility to deal with it humanely and to — and to stop what’s happening.  And so, this increase has been consequential, but the Vice President has agreed — among the multiple other things that We’re already talking with Mexico about that; she’s already done that.  We’re going to be dealing with a full team now that we have to be able to deal with the problem here at home, but also to deal with it now in terms of in country.   And So it’s not her full responsibility and job, but she’s leading the effort because But — so, Madam Vice President, thank you.  And We will collaborate with Mexico and other countries throughout the Western hemisphere.  And as part of this effort, we expect that we will have collaborative relationships to accomplish the goals the President has and that we share.   So thank you, Mr. President, for your confidence.  Thank you.    Well, thank you for willing to do it.  Now we’re going to get down to business here.  And, Ron, who am 2:23 P.M.             can’t hear a word you’re saying.         Pardon me?     Not as of today.  No,     Well, that — that depends on how — what is finally approved.  Okay?  Thank you.      No.  According to the Defense Department, it’s business as usual.  There’s no new — there’s no new wrinkle in what they did.               Columbus, Ohio  5:26 P.M.  My heart goes out to the families of the victims and the survivors.   Now, let me turn to why   And Madam President, thanks for having served in the Obama-Biden administration, and you’re doing an incredible job here.  And all of the docs that are here that   Look,  And what my  So, by the end of May, we’re going to have on hand roughly 600 million doses — enough for every American.  And the American Rescue Plan is also going to provide the funding for more vaccinations, vaccination sites, vaccinators, and the paraphernalia needed to put that vaccine in one’s arm.   In addition, there is a second important piece of that plan.  It’s focused on dealing with the economic deprivation so many Americans have become subject to — a consequence to this virus through no fault of their own.  Millions have lost their jobs, and they’re still out of work.  Around 11 million children in America are going hungry through no fault of their own.  But as a result of the pandemic and the economic crisis, millions of Americans are not able to maintain their mortgage payments or rental payments and have found themselves on the verge of being evicted and having their homes repossessed.  But we stepped in, and we prevented that from happening with the American Rescue Plan.  Hundreds of thousands of businesses are now — not going to go under, but they’re going to have an idea — an opportunity to reopen and have the financial assistance to be able to do it the right way and safely.  Schools closed and children losing up to a year or more in learning capacity.  You’re ahead of the  here in Ohio, but, across the nation, the help was badly needed, and we’ve now provided the funding for that.  Because of isolation — and violence against women is up; abuse of children is up — and the need for mental health problems — to deal with mental health problems and the consequence of them is up, as a consequence of COVID.  And, in addition to that, suicides are up.   The second — so, second, the American Rescue Plan brings relief to a population that is badly hurting.  And one more element of our response is that — first and foremost, is the commitment to get Americans a $1,400 check per person, including per child.  So, a firefighter and school teacher making $120,000 combined, with two kids, are going to get a $5,6000 in cash.  If they already have an account online with the IRS, which many do, by tomorrow, we will have distributed 100 million of those checks just since the legislation passed.  We’re on the verge of doing that as of tomorrow.  But for someone who doesn’t have direct deposit, they’re getting a check in the mail for all of that.   So we expand the child — we also expanded the Childcare Tax Credit.  Right now, if you file your federal income tax, you’ll get to a $2,000 deduction for every child you have.  But if you’re making the minimum wage, you don’t earn enough to file for federal taxes.  But because of the American Rescue Plan, if you have two children, for example, under the age of six, you’re going to get a check for $3,600 if you have a child.  And so, if you have two children, $7,200 will be paid on a monthly basis.  This is going to be life changing.  It’s estimated this will do more to end child poverty in America than anything we’ve ever done.   There’s the Earned Income Tax Credit.  If you are over the age of 19 and not a fulltime student and you are a childless worker, now you will get a check for $1,500 if you file.   Small businesses not only will be able to borrow money to keep business afloat, but get loan forgiveness in improving your business to get us back in the game.  And, by the way, all of this — economists left, right, and center argue and acknowledge — will create 7 million more jobs and increase economic growth.  Increase economic growth.  There’s so much more, but help is here.  But I’m here in this great hospital to talk about a third way to help.  And that is for your health — the third type of help, and that’s healthcare.   Because of our investments, this department has gone from being able to treat 60 to 70 patients a day to nearly 300 a day.  This place is a source of hope.    And when we see the strides we’ve made — you talk to the docs and researchers —  Well, I’m going to be proposing to my friends in Congress that we launch a similar operation at the Department of — at the Department of Health — a new effort called “ARPA-H” — to deliver health breakthroughs to find cures for cancer and other diseases by investing billions of dollars that companies are not willing to do — drug companies are not — don’t have the capacity.  And  America does big things.  Eleven years ago today, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act — historic achievement that would not have been possible but for the vision and determination of one of the most successful Presidents in recent American history: Barack Obama.    But, look, on this anniversary, we should remember just how close we have come to losing that act we so fought so hard for.  And we have a duty not just to protect it, but to make it better and keep becoming a nation where healthcare is a right for all and not a privilege for a few.  When  If you’re enrolled in Obamacare, you’re going to save an average of $50 a month — $600 a year — by the reduction of payments.  For a family of four earning $90,000 a year, that could save you $200 a month in savings.  For a 60-year-old couple here in Ohio earning $75,000 per year, it could save them about $1,000 per month and to maintain the same healthcare.  That’s $12,000 a year in your pocket that you didn’t have before.  Because of the American Rescue Plan, if you lost healthcare because you lost your job or your hours were cut, we pay your contribution and your employer’s contribution under the so-called COBRA.  That’s what your employer-based health insurance was.  And so since — if they’ve gone out of business or you’re no longer there because you had to be laid off, you can stay covered for up to six months until you get back on your feet, because, look, the federal government will cover both ends of that  For millions who are out of work and have no coverage, thanks to this law, there’s an Obamacare plan that most folks can get with zero-dollar premiums.  Co-pays will still be there, but zero-dollar premiums.  Four out of five Americans shopping on the Obamacare marketplace can get quality healthcare with a premium of $10 a month or less.  Let me say that again: Four out of five Americans who shop for a plan will find one for $10 or less per month.  It’s especially important in communities that historically have gone without insurance at higher rates.  Very few communities that have always faced health disparities — Black, Brown, and Asian, Native American communities — have borne the brunt of the  And we’re also making it easy to — easier to sign up for Obamacare.  We’ve opened Healthcare.gov for special enrollment on February the 15th.  In the first two weeks alone, more than 200,000 Americans gained coverage.  Today I’m pleased to announce that we’ve extended that period to run through August the 15th.  Just go to HealthCare.gov or call the national hotline: 1-800-318-2596.  That’s 1-800-318-2596.   I’ll close with this: With the American Rescue Plan and the Affordable Care Act, millions of families will be able to sleep a little more soundly at night because they don’t have to worry about losing everything if they get sick.   I, like many of you, grew up in a middle-class —  People lying in bed wondering, “My God, what happens?  What happens if, in fact,  That’s the difference.  And we’re going to keep building until every American has that peace of mind and to show that our government can fulfill its most essential purpose: to care for and protect the American people.  When we work together, we can do big things, important things, necessary things.   We saw it 11 years ago with the Affordable Care Act.  We saw it 11 days ago when we marked the signing of the American Rescue Plan.  But we’re not done yet.  Last week, we met my goal that  Well, this week, we’re announcing a new goal: to get more people vaccinated.  But we need all Americans to keep washing your hands, staying socially distanced, and wearing the mask when you’re in public, as recommended by the CDC.  And get vaccinated when it’s your turn.  It’s a patriotic responsibility you have.  Now is not the time to let down our guard.  If we all do our part, after a long, dark year, we can show once again that we are the United States of America; that there’s nothing we have — cannot do if we do it together.  We’re going to beat this pandemic.  And because of the great docs up this staircase here, we’re going to beat cancer as we know it as well.  We’re going to make sure, once and for all, that healthcare is a right, not a privilege, in this nation.  So    5:42 P.M.        Columbus, Ohio   6:34 P.M.   Yeah,   It was a foreign policy issue.    Well,   We — we have the most diverse Cabinet in history.  We have a lot of Asian Americans who are in the Cabinet and sub-Cabinet levels.  Our Cabinet is formed.     I’ll have more to say about that in the next couple of days.  The key here relates to what’s happening in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.  And the last administration dismantled all we had put in place, relative to dealing with the problems in country.  And we’ll have something to say about that very shortly.     I’ll more to say about that tomorrow and the next day.    We have learned that there is nothing much has changed.   Thank you.   6:36 P.M.        Columbus, Ohio  3:49 P.M.   It’s — it’s mostly hopeful because One of the things you should be aware of: There are probably more soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines coming home with brain cancers than any time in American history because of exposure.  Some of you have read about the burn pits.  There’s a lot of research that still has to be done to determine whether or not exposure to these toxins in the air have something to do with it.  Also, you have an awful lot of these IEDs have caused brain trauma in other ways as well.   So, it really is something that Same thing now with an IED.  If you were near a concussion, you have a problem with — it’s assumed the government has responsibility for it.  And — but there’s a lot going on, and the Doc could tell you more.   But one of things that really excites me, Doc, is the idea that we’re moving into potential immunotherapy initiatives that — what they did with Beau, they injected an adenovirus into the brain.   DR. ARNAB:  Exactly.    And it — they were — they were giddy, initially, at all of the — the human body coming in to eat up the virus, but it just kept going.  And because there had been some damage from radiation on a blood vessel, it — things got — it didn’t work.   But there’s real hope for people.  There’s real hope.  DR. ARNAB:  And, Mr. President, with this   Yeah, DR. ARNAB:  — we’re finding.    Not that DR. ARNAB:  And our Proton Center, which will be — will treat our first patient 2023 — will have   Explain the difference between a proton and radiation going —  DR. ARNAB:  Yes, great question.  Great question.     It’s really important.  DR. ARNAB:  Yes.  So with conventional radiation therapy, like this unit right behind you, sir, this produces high-level X-ray energy radiation that’s penetrative.  It goes through normal tissues as well as tumor.  So everything is treated: normal tissues and tumor together.   With proton therapy, the dose stops right at the tumor so you’re not treating normal tissues.  So it’s a major advancement in the treatment of cancers.    Treating normal tissue sometimes is a very bad thing.  Just — it also — it can destroy a normal tissue.  It can destroy the cancer — hit that — but it goes through the cancer and destroys whatever is beyond it.  Not just in the brain, but wherever it —  And so that’s why DR. ARNAB:  Yes.     And because it doesn’t have the same application, but it does less damage when it occurs — when there is damage done.  And — but it really is one of my regrets of becoming President: And — but it is something that there’s a lot — these guys are on the edge of so many things.  Think about it: Jimmy Carter was declared basically gone five times.  Now, he’s in trouble now, but it’s amazing that — you know, it’s a little bit like — it’s why you should never give up hope.  When the breakthrough comes, it just comes through.  Not planned — it’s just, “Woah, we got it.”  Anyway.  I’m talking too much.    3:54 P.M.                There’s still a great deal we don’t know about the killer and the motivation of the killer in Boulder, Colorado, and other critical aspects of this mass shooting.  I’ve been briefed this morning by the Attorney General of the United States, the Director of the FBI.  I’ve spoken with the governor, and I’ll be speaking with the mayor on the aircraft.  We’re working very closely with the state and local law enforcement officials, and they’re going to keep me updated as they learn more.  You’re going to ask me to speculate — understandably, you’re going to ask me to speculate on what happened, why it happened.  And I’m not going to do that now because we don’t have all the information — not until But Less than a week after the horrific murders of eight people and the assault on the And the state that — The second point You know, when he pinned on that badge yesterday morning, he didn’t know what the day would bring.  He thought he’d be coming home to his family and his seven children.  But when the moment to act came, Officer Talley did not hesitate in his duty, making the ultimate sacrifice in his effort to save lives.  That’s a definition of an American hero.  And thirdly, We can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again.  We can close the loopholes in our background check system, including the “Charleston loophole.”  That’s one of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence.  The Senate should immediately pass — let me say it again: The United States Senate — I’ll have much more to say as we learn more, but May God bless you all and those families who are mourning today because of gun violence in Colorado and Georgia and all across the country.  We have to act so there’s not more of you — there’s fewer of you, as time goes on.   Thank you so much.    I’ll talk to you about that later.  Thank you.  1:02 P.M.            At some point,          Thank you.         Atlanta, Georgia  5:54 P.M. As many of you know, we originally planned to hold a car rally to thank our supporters.  But given the recent days –events of recent days, we didn’t feel it was appropriate, so we cancelled that rally.  But we want our supporters to know we’ll come back and hold that rally another trip.  But today, we want to speak about something else.  There are simply some core values and beliefs that should bring us together as Americans.  One of them is standing together against hate, against racism — the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our nation.   The Vice President and I, as We talked about Tuesday’s mass shooting, about another example of public health crisis, of gun violence in this country.  Eight people killed, seven women.   Six were of Asian descent.  All fellow Americans.  Each one of them we mourn.  Their families are left with broken hearts and unanswered questions.  And the investigation is ongoing.  And the Vice President and But whatever the motivation, we know this: Too many Asian Americans have been walking up and down the streets and worrying, waking up each morning the past year feeling their safety and the safety of their loved ones are at stake.  They’ve been attacked, blamed, scapegoated, and harassed.  They’ve been verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed.   Documented incidents against — of hate against Asian Americans have seen a skyrocketing spike over the last year, let alone the ones that happened and never get reported.  It’s been a year of living in fear for their lives just to walk down the street.  Grandparents leave — to leave — afraid to leave their homes.  Small-business owners targeted and gunned down.  Attacks on some of the most vulnerable people in our nation — the elderly, low-wage workers, and women.   In fact, Asian American women suffer twice as many incidents of harassment and violence as Asian American men.  We’re learning again what we’ve always known: Words have consequences.  It’s the coro- — it’s the coronavirus.  Full stop.   The conversation we had today with the In my first week in office, I’m calling on Congress to pass and get my — to get to my desk the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act.  And the House just passed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, a law But for all the good that laws can do, we have to change our hearts.  Hate can have no safe harbor in America.  It must stop.  And it’s on all of us — all of us, together — to make it stop.  Something else should bring us together, and that is a belief in science.  Science isn’t something that should divide us.  There’s nothing political about it.  There’s nothing partisan about it.   One of America’s best examples of commitment to science is headquartered right here in Atlanta: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The And we wanted to convey to them the absolute commitment to give them everything they need to do their work and get it done — free of politics and guided by science.  And because of them, we’re making real progress.  We just met my goal of administering 100 million shots before my first 100 days in office.  We did it in about 60 days.  We’re not stopping now.   The American Rescue funds more vaccines, more vaccination centers, and more increases in testing.  It’s going to help us accelerate our nationwide effort to reopen schools safely.   Last week, None of this is political.  It’s all science-based.  But now is not the time to let down our guard down.  That’s science-based as well.   In the last week, we’ve seen — we’ve seen increases in the number of cases in several states.  Things may get worse as new variants of the virus spread.  That’s why we need to vaccinate as many people as quickly as we possibly can, because it’s the best thing we can do to fight back against these variants.  We will do — we have to beat this virus.  We have to, and we will.  But we’ll do it by setting aside politics and embracing science.   On another subject, the right to vote — that should bring us together as well, but it now divides us.  This is a democracy, and the right to vote is fundamental.  The fact that there was a record turnout in America in the last election, in the midst of a pandemic, should be something we celebrated, not attacked.   The fact that you held a free and fair election in Georgia that stood up to recount after recount, court case after court case, is something you should be proud of.   The fact that your poll workers, your election workers, your volunteers, your local officials, your state officials, your courts stood up to the immense pressure with character and honesty and integrity helped save our democracy.  And this country will long be grateful for it.   But as this state, home to Martin Luther King and John Lewis, knows better than most: The battle for the right to vote is never, ever over.  And it’s not over here, in this state of Georgia.   So we’re in the fight again.  It’s a fight we need to win.  Because if anyone ever doubted that voting matters, Georgia just proved it did.  If anyone ever wondered if one vote can make a difference, Georgia just proved it 11,779 times.  And if anyone ever wondered if voting can change a country, Georgia just proved it can.  Because when you elected two new United States senators, you made it possible to pass the American Rescue Plan.   Landmark legislation will not only meet the emergency we’re in, but transform this nation — starting with this: For those folks who either already have or will soon have $1,400 in their pockets, you can thank Senators Warnock and Ossoff.  But for their votes, it would not have happened.   What does that mean?  It means 85 percent of the households in America will get that money.  Here in Georgia, it means 88 percent of all adults and 88 percent of the children in this state will get that $1,400 as well.  Just add it up.  And that’s not all.  There’s something called a “child tax credit.”  What that basically means is you get a tax credit for every child you have.  The American Rescue Plan expands that credit.  It means that families of over 2 million children in Georgia will be eligible for an increase in that child tax credit of [up to] $1,600 per year [sic] — per child.  And it’s going to be delivered on a regular basis.   So, starting this summer, families with young kids will get $300 a month per child.  This is going to lift 177,000 [171,000] children in Georgia out of poverty.  The American Rescue Plan expands coverage and reduces costs under the Affordable Care Act.  So for a family of four earning $90,000 per year, with insurance under the Affordable Care Act, they’ll see about $200 a month off their monthly premiums.   And for Georgia’s schools, the American Rescue Plan provides around $4 billion for Georgia’s schoolchildren, grades And here’s one of the biggest things for Georgia: Because of the American Rescue Plan, Georgia is now eligible for about $2 billion to expand Medicaid.  What does that mean?  It means another 500,000 Georgians will be covered all across this state with Medicaid that don’t have it now.   For your state and local governments, this is what it does: State government will get around $5 billion to make up for lost revenue.  Local governments will get around $3.5 billion.  That’s going to make it possible to keep a lot of police officers, firefighters, teachers, and other first responders on the job.   And here’s one final thing the American Rescue Plan does: For the first time in a long time, it puts the working families, the middle class — people who built this country — first, not last.  Sixty-six percent of the tax breaks in this plan go to folks making $90,000 or less a year.  And how much for the top 1 percent — where 83 percent of all of the tax cut — it was the last President’s tax cut?  Zero.  The top 1 percent get zero.   But the American Rescue Plan isn’t only about putting money in the pockets — people’s pockets.  It also will create and spur economic growth in America.  That’s why major economists — left, right, and center — support this plan.  Even Wall Street agrees.  According to Moody’s, this law will help America create 7 million new jobs by the end of the year.  And we’ll do it by rebuilding the backbone of this nation: the working people, the middle class — the people who built this country.    It’s about giving those people a fair shot, for a change. It’s about providing and proving to the American people that their government works and can deliver for them, which brings me to my last point.   The American Rescue Plan is a plan that brings America together and benefits all America.  That’s why so many polls show that over 70 percent of the country support it, including Democrats, Republicans, and independents.  Maybe Republicans in Washington didn’t vote for it, but the American Rescue Plan sure has brought the country together.  And, for me, that measure of unity, that’s what matters.  Let me end with this: There is so much we can do if we do it together; if we remember who we are; if we stand together against hate; once again believe and invest in science; if we stand up for the right of all Americans to vote and have access to voting; if we remember we’re here to help all the people of this country, not just those few at the top; if we remember to do justice, love mercy, to walk humbly as fellow human beings and as fellow Americans; if we remember we’re the United States of America and that, together, there is nothing — not a single thing — we cannot do if we do it together.   My heart goes out to all — all the family members who lost someone in those horrific shootings on Tuesday.  May God bless all those families.  May God protect our troops.  Thank you very much.  6:10 P.M.        Atlanta, Georgia  2:17 P.M.   And   DR. LIBURD:  Thank you.  Dr. Walensky?  Thank you so much.   DR. WALENSKY:  Any other questions for us?     No, but why are y’all standing?     That’s the first one.  You don’t have to stand for us.  Why don’t you sit down?  For real.  Get comfortable.    PARTICIPANT:  No chair.     No, they have chairs.  They have chairs.    But, you know, that’s — that’s the first question.   And the second question is, why did only one person clap?    The reason   We can build all the walls we want.  We can have the most powerful armies in the world, but we can’t — but we cannot stop — we cannot stop these viruses, other than be aware of where they are and move quickly on them when we find them.    And the one thing that   No, all kidding aside.  Think about it: For the longest time, not just — not just as it relates to CDC, but science — science was viewed as — as sort of an appendage to anything else we were talking about.  But it’s back.   And   When   The point is, the public is thankful to you, because it’s about science.  That’s what they understand.  They understand.    And we’re not going back to the old days.  Even if tomorrow the whole administration changed,   So, to all of the folks listening —   DR. WALKE:  Yes.     Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.    There’s an entire generation coming up that is learning from what you’ve done.    So we owe you a debt of gratitude in all the lives you’ve saved.    It’s got to stop.  But you’re slowing it.  It’s stopping. And it really, really matters.  You know, that’s more people than have died in all of World War — Americans — all of World War One, World War Two, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined — combined — in a year.  In a year.    And you are the Army.  You’re the Navy.  You’re the Marines.  You’re the Coast Guard.    And, finally, we got the vaccines.  We got the companies together.  And then they didn’t have the wherewithal to be able to produce all the vaccines.   So there’s a thing called the Defense Production Act.  As President, I’m allowed to enforce it.  So   We finally put together — did you ever think you’d see the day — because you’ve all been involved with medicine — see two major drug companies cooperate for the good of the country?  One invent — one come up with the drug, and the other say, “Well, we’ll manufacture it for you”?   So what — what you’re doing really, really, really matters, not only — and I’ll end with this — not only in saving lives, but changing the mindset of the country.  Changing the mindset of the country.  And it’s affected everything, not just affected people’s health.  It’s affected their attitude — the attitude about what we can do as a country.   Everybody thought that   But here’s the point: The point is that it is changing the way we look at a whole range of things.  And when   So   And this is, as   Closing comment:   His President and mine wanted us to get to know one another because it was clear he was going to become the President.  And   But all kidding aside, he asked me — we were on the Tibetan Plateau.  He asked me and said to me, “Can you define America for me?”  And   And so   And       Oh, just sorry.     And everyone here knows, before the President was President, he was dedicated to science — the Moonshot.  And so — and my mother was a scientist.    And then there was this moment of global crisis.  And the President takes calls with leaders around the world.  We talk with people around the world.  And they have named their centers of disease control after this center of disease control.  They put their — the name of their country, and they call it “CDC.”    You all are a model for the world around what can be done based on a pursuit of that which will uplift and improve human condition and life.  And you guys do this work around the clock.    And so we are here to say thank you — because it’s not easy.  You’re making difficult decisions right now, some of the most difficult, but you’re making those decisions based on science, based on hard work, and based on a commitment to the public health.  And therein lies part of the nobility of your work.    You do this work on behalf of people you will never meet, on behalf of people who will never know your names because you care about our country and their wellbeing.  So we are here to thank you.  Thank you.   2:29 P.M.         3:26 P.M.  When  When  So,  And I’m proud to announce that tomorrow, 58 days into our administration, we will have met my goal of administering 100 million shots to our fellow Americans.   That’s weeks ahead of schedule, and even with the setbacks we faced during the winter storms.  And it’s another big step on the path to checking the — putting checks in pockets and shots in people’s arms.   When we crossed the 50 million doses just three weeks ago,    So here is where we are today: Eight weeks ago, only 8 percent of seniors, those most vulnerable to COVID-19, had received a vaccination.  Today, 65 percent of people aged 65 or older have received at least one shot, and 36 percent are fully vaccinated.  And that’s key — because this is a population that represents 80 percent of the well over 500,000 COVID-19 deaths that have occurred in America.  We have nearly doubled the amount of vaccine doses that we distribute to states, Tribes, and territories each week.  We have gone from 1 million shots a day — that  And here’s how we accomplished this: Using the power given to a President under the Defense Production Act, we expedited critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies.  We worked with vaccine manufacturers to speed up the delivery of millions more doses and brokered a historic manufacturing partnership between competing companies who put patriotism and public health first.  These steps put us on track to have enough vaccine — enough vaccine supply for every adult American by the end of May — months — months earlier than anyone expected.  And we stood up or supplied more than 600 community vaccination sites that are administering hundreds of thousands of shots per day.   We launched the Federal Pharmacy Program, which has allowed millions of Americans to get a shot at one of one thous- — or, excuse me, one of 14,000 local pharmacies in this country, the same way they get their flu shot.   And for folks who aren’t near a pharmacy or mass vaccination center, we’ve supplied more than 500 mobile clinics, like pop-up sites or vans, meeting people where they are — meeting people where they are.  We’ve developed nearly — we’ve deployed nearly 6,000 federal personnel, including FEMA, active-duty military, and  Department of Health and Human Services to support vaccinations  and serve as vaccinators — putting the needle in people’s arms.  We’re also supplying vaccines to community health centers to reach those who have been the hardest hit — the hardest hit — and suffered the most, especially Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities.  This is really important — because we believe that speed and efficiency must be matched with fairness and equity.     Now, when [Vice] President Harris and  Behind these 100 million shots are millions of lives changed when people receive that dose of hope: Grandparents can hug their grandchildren again.  Frontline workers who can show up at their jobs without the same fear they used to have.  Teachers — with the confidence to head back into the classroom.  These milestones are significant accomplishments, but we have much more to do.  Much more to do.  And the American Rescue Plan will help us do it.  In addition to the cash payments it provides to you and your families, it also provides the funds to add vaccinators, to supply [sic] more community vaccination — support more community vaccination centers, and increase testing.  It will help us accelerate nationwide efforts to reopen our schools safely.  And as  Tomorrow, we will hit 100 million doses our administration has administered.  But I’ve always said: That’s just the floor.  We will not stop until we beat this pandemic.  Next week,  This is a time for optimism, but it’s not a time for relaxation.   In the last week, we’ve seen increases in the number of cases in several states.  Scientists have made clear that things may get worse as new variants of this virus spread.  Getting vaccinated is the best thing we can do to fight back against these variants.    While millions of people are vaccinated, we need millions more to be vaccinated.  And, again,  If we keep our guard up, stick together, and stick with the science, we can look forward to a Fourth of July that feels a bit more normal, with small groups able to gather for cookouts in backyards, and when we’ll be — where we begin to declare our independence on Independence Day from the virus.   Look, together — together we’re going to come through this stronger, with renewed faith in each other, in our government that fulfills its most important function: protecting the American people.  Let me be clear again: wearing this mask, in the meantime; making sure you wash your hands; making sure you socially distance and listen to the CDC.  We’ve got to reach the point where we have herd immunity — meaning where we have a vast majority of the American people have been vaccinated — before we can stop wearing these.   So, please, please, don’t let what’s happening — you see happening in Europe and you see on television.  Keep the faith.  Keep wearing the mask, keep washing your hands, and keep socially distanced.  We’re going to beat this.  We’re way ahead of schedule, but we’ve got a long way to go.   So  Thank you so much.                                                    Oval Office    1:20 P.M. And But whatever the motivation here, And — but I’m making no connection at this moment for the motivation of what the — of the killer.  I’m waiting for an answer from — as the investigation proceeds, from the Now, Then we’d go into this very office.  You’d sit in the chair over here — the Taoiseach would sit there.  And I’d sit where — where the — my National Security Advisor is sitting, and we’d have a long discussion with the President.  And then we’d go up to the — up to the United States Capitol where the Speaker of the House, starting with Tip O’Neill, would put on an event as well.  And then And tonight, Taoiseach, My — my grandfather, Ambrose Finnegan, who was a great football player — American football — and a newspaper man back at the turn of the 19th — of the 20th century, used to always say when — later when he was much older and I’d walk out of his home, he’d say, “Joey, remember: The best drop of blood in you is Irish.”    And we have a lot of great memories as well in our family because one of your predecessors — And so, And we have a — Ireland and United States have a robust agenda that we got to deal with on the substantive side of this — of these issues, Taoiseach, and — from combating COVID, to strengthening global health security, to also discussing our economic cooperation and Ireland’s leadership now in the U.N. Security Council, which we’re working together.  Our U.N. Ambassador is online with us here.  And And you know my view and the view of my predecessor, my — of the Obama-Biden administration on the Good Friday Agreements.  We strongly support them; think it’s critically important that they be maintained.  And the political and economic stability of Northern Ireland is very much in the interest of all our peoples — the people-to-people ties.   And As a matter of fact, my relatives in — in Mayo just dedicated a — my — Laurita, one of my cousins, headed up the hospice effort for cancer — not just cancer, but hospice in — in Ireland.  And they just dedicated a new significant facility to my son Beau Biden, who — who died of cancer.   And so, everything between Ireland and the United States runs deep, Taoiseach.  Our — our joys, our sorrows, our passion, our drive, and our unrelenting optimism and hope.  One of the few quotes that I’ve been given credit for over my career was, It’s a — it’s a great — a great opportunity for you and But as we used to say in the United States Senate, Taoiseach, “But Now, as you said, it seems strange to have to celebrate apart.  As you know well, Irish people love to come together to celebrate our heritage and culture with song, with dance, with parades, with poetry, and with pride.   And this year, because of the pandemic, it just simply is impossible.  And here in Ireland, people are make — are marking the occasion in their homes, but they will be thinking especially of their loved ones around the world and sending them best thoughts and wishes.  And they will do so in the hope that next year will be better, as For now, the bowl of shamrock in front of you is a symbol of the undying friendship between our two countries — a symbol of the good times we have shared and the challenges we’ve endured, always at each other’s side.  The green shoots point to the brighter future that We should share notes on our plans to recovery, getting back the ground lost to the pandemic.  Both the United States and Europe have put funds of unprecedented scale in place to support this vital work and to build a stable and inclusive future supporting the digital and green agendas, promoting open and fair rules-based trade, delivering greater equality and opportunity.   Mr. President, the world has rightly taken great heart from the steps you have already taken to bring the U.S. back to center stage on global health, on climate, and on human rights.  We want to work with you to promote our shared values and interests in the world, including at the United Nations Security Council on which we are, as you said, currently serving.  We want to work with you on time and action, which becomes ever more urgent as we approach COP26 later this year.  Today, There are so many areas where the Irish and American people are already working together, and we would celebrate some of them here today: a consortium through which our practitioners and researchers would improve their efforts to defeat cancer — that most pernicious disease that Mr. President, thank you.  And thank you, Mr. President.  1:34 P.M.        Chester, Pennsylvania   3:30 P.M. And I’m not being solicitous when And one of the things that we’ve done early on — they passed the So when we wrote this Rescue Plan, they were  insistent that we have an inspector general to make sure the money goes exactly where it’s supposed to go.  And so we’re in a position where it’s going to bring immediate relief — $1,400 — to 85 percent of the American public.  And you know so many of the people who have worked  and gotten themselves laid off or there wasn’t work, and you find yourself, you know, it’s hard paying the rent, hard paying the childcare, hard paying for much of anything.   So Initially, at the very beginning of the Paycheck Protection Program, you’d go to a big bank, they’d say, “Do you have an account with us?  Have you borrowed money from us?  Do you have a credit card from us?”  They didn’t want to deal with people who were on the short side of things.  But you’ve really made it work.  And Do you have questions for me at all?   MS. SMITH:  Well, we don’t have any questions, but we did want to say thank you.  Thank you for your being who you are.  Thank you for helping the small business — small minority business.  It means a lot that you’re here in Chester.  It means a lot that you came to see our business because, you know, although Congresswoman Scanlon and Congresswoman Hou- — Houlahan, I’m sorry.    Every time MS. SMITH:  That’s true.      playing Chester.  So a lot of my buddies are from Chester, for real.  The people And it’s — you know, one of the things that we haven’t — and we’re trying like the devil to make sure to correct is: People who are hardest hit by — and the Congresswoman knows this better than And in the last place — and that’s why we’re working so hard — they’re working so hard to make sure to get the vaccines in places that are not ordinarily the focus.  That’s why we put these vaccines in community health centers.  That’s why we have them in drugstores now.  That’s why we have mobile units.   But I’m not — I’m not just saying this because we’re here.  They have been loud and strong voices — “Get this done.”  And it’s not like it passed with 100 votes.  You know what And So is there anything else we can be doing?  MS. SMITH:  We just want —    How many employees at your peak?  MR. SMITH:  At our peak, we’re at about 20, 23 people.  Our peak is summertime.  We do a lot of school work, and so that’s when we get our big boost.    Yeah.  MR. SMITH:  Right now we’re about 12 — 12 people between people in the office, out in the field.     MR. SMITH:  And it’s great that schools got funding, so now the schools are going to do some construction and .    Yeah.  No, it’s a big deal.  It’s a big deal.  Well, you both do a heck of a job.   MS. SMITH:  Thank you.  3:36 P.M.         2:03 P.M.  The first is, 100 million shots in people’s arms will have been completed within the next 10 days, and 100 million checks in people’s pockets in the next 100 [10] days.  Shots in arms and money in pockets — that’s important.   The American Rescue Plan is already doing what it was designed to do: make a difference in people’s everyday lives.  And we’re just getting started.  By the time all the money is distributed, 85 percent of American households will have gotten a $1,400 rescue checks.   To give more — to give one more example: For the average family of two parents and two children making a combined income of $110,000 a year, that’s going to add $5,600 for them — $5,600 they’ll get.   And the plan does a lot more.  It extends unemployment insurance for the 11 million Americans unemployed and any who will be unemployed in the near term.   It will help hundreds of thousands of small businesses keep their doors open, which makes a gigantic difference in neighborhoods and communities.  If you have a drugstore, if you have a — a beauty shop, a hardware store, it’s the center of small communities.   And it gets our schools and — resources they need to open safely.  It provides the biggest investment in childcare since World War Two.  And it provides food and nutrition help for the millions of families to keep them from going hungry, keeping a roof over their heads.  And it expands healthcare coverage and lowers healthcare costs for so many people.   And it will cut child poverty in half in this country.  That’s the estimate: Child poverty will be cut in half as a consequence of what’s in this recovery act.   And it will generate economic growth for the entire nation.  That’s why major economists — left, right, and center — support this plan.  Even Wall Street has agreed.  According to Moody’s, by the end of this year, this law will spur our economy to create 7 million new jobs.   And it does one more thing: It focuses on rebuilding the backbone of this country — working families, the middle class, the people who built this country.   But as  Look, I’ve been here before.  When President Obama and   Accordingly, to the oversight board that these — of inspectors general — they said we got it done with less than two tenths of 1 percent waste or fraud.  And that’s not what the previous administration did though.  When the Congress, last year, passed the   And today, I’m pleased to announce and introduce another gifted manager to coordinate our implementation of the American Rescue Plan: Gene Sperling.  Gene will be on the phone with mayors and governors — red states, blue states.   Gene has been here before.  The only person in history to serve as director of economic — of the National Economic Council twice.  He led successful efforts to deliver relief to small businesses and unemployed Americans in the Obama-Biden administration and in the Clinton administration.    Let me close with this: Help is here and hope is here in real and tangible ways.  We’re just days away from 100 million shots in millions — in the arms of millions of Americans.  That’s the way.  That’s the way — on the way to get every single American access to the vaccine.  One hundred million checks going into the pockets — and/or direct deposits — going into the pockets of Americans, on the way to a million more — millions of more Americans.  That’s real progress.  But we have a lot more to do.   We have to prove to the American people that their government can deliver for them, and do it without waste or fraud; that we can vaccinate the nation; that we can get our kids safely back in school; and we can get our economy back on track by helping hundreds of thousands of small businesses open and stay open; and that we can give people of this nation a fighting chance again with relief checks, lower childcare costs, lower healthcare costs, and so much more.  That’s our job.  That’s our responsibility.   And in the process, we’ll be growing the economy as well.  We’re going to have to stay on top of every dollar spent through the American Rescue Plan.  And that’s what we’re going to do.  We can do this.  We will do this.   God bless you all.  Help us on the way.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you very, very much.      I’m hearing a lot of reports from serious reporters like you saying that.   So  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  2:12 P.M.         2:44 P.M. But today, with the American Rescue Plan now signed into law, we’ve delivered on that promise.  And And But all kidding aside, And, you know, But all kidding aside, we’ve still got a lot of great majority leaders.  But And look — and to the members of the House and Senate, thanks for making this happen.  You made it happen.  As And, Nancy and Chuck, And here’s why: Because what you all did with it and the refinements you made, it directly addressed the emergency in this country because it focuses on what people need most.   Debbie and This leg- — this legislation, as everybody has already mentioned, will provide $1,400 in direct payments, which we all promised.  Well, that means for a typical family of four — a middle-class family, husband and wife working, making $110,000 a year — that means a $5,600 check they’re going to get.  Eighty-five percent of the households in America will be getting this money.    Now, a lot of you know — because of the way you came up like And they’re going to — some are going to get it as early as this weekend.  This legislation provides resources needed to open our schools.  How many of you have dealt not only in your own home and with your children and grandchildren, if you have them, with how difficult it is, the mental pressure and stress that are on so many families?  So many people needing — need — needing help — if they had access to counseling — because it’s caused an enormous, enormous stress.   This legislation extends unemployment insurance by $300 a week until September.  It’s going to help 11 million Americans who were days from losing that benefit.  This legislation includes the biggest investment in childcare since World War Two.  That’s not hyperbole; that’s just a fact.  It’s a fact.   It provides help for small businesses to stay open.  And, you know, four hundred thou- — so many have had to close because, the first time around, you all worked and did a great piece of work, and the House passed a significant legislation.  What’s the first thing the last President — he fired — he fired the folks who were supposed to watch and make sure it got, in fact, distributed the way it was supposed to.  We find out so much of it went to people who didn’t need it.  You all took care of that.   It extends coverage and lowers healthcare costs for so many Americans.  So many Americans.  And it’s a big number for people.   It provides for food and nutrition.  Because people knew — and you all were out there handing out food like many of us were, but you saw people who were in car lines that were literally miles long.  You’d see four lanes of cars that went back for a half a mile each, just to get a box of food.  Again, through no fault of their own.   It’s going to help people keep a roof over their heads.  It’s going to cut job poverty in half with — with — and, you know, I’ve talked to so many of you.  Rosa, you and I’ve spent so much time on this.  But you guys — you, Patty, and others — are the ones that have been leading this for so long, and it’s finally coming to fruition.  And the American people understand it.   It pays for many of the steps we’ve taken on — to vaccinate Americans.  We’re going to be in a position where, because of what you all did in the past, we had the money to go out and literally purchase hundreds of millions of vaccines, and then go out and make sure we had enough vaccinators.  Vaccine is one thing.  To get the vaccine in a vial, out of that vial and into a needle, and a needle into someone’s arm — it took tens of thousands of people.   And because of you, we were able to mobilize the military.  We were able to mobilize FEMA.  We were able — And one of the things that we said in the beginning that no one thought that And the bill does one more thing, which For too long, it’s been the folks at the top.  They’re not bad folks.  We’ve seen time and time again that that trickle down does not work.  And, by the way, we don’t have anything against wealthy people.  You got a great idea, you’re going to go out and make millions of dollars — that’s fine.  This time, it’s time that we build an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out —  — the middle out.  And this bill shows that when you do that, everybody does better.  The wealthy do better.  Everybody does better across the board.   If that’s our foundation, then everything we build upon will be strong — a strong foundation: our competitiveness around the world, the jobs here at home, the health and quality of our lives.  That’s what the American Rescue Plan represents, and it’s all about rebuilding what I’ve been saying, and Bernie and a lot of others are saying — the backbone of this country.  The backbone of this country are hardworking folks.  Hardworking folks.  Middle-class folks.  People who built the country.  And In the coming weeks, Jill and I, and Kamala and Doug, and our Cabinet, with all of you — members of Congress — we’re going to be traveling the country to speak directly to the American people about how this law is going to make a real difference in their lives and how help is here for them.  Almost every single aspect would be significant — would be every — if you took the piece of this bill and broke it into all of the pieces, every one of those pieces standing alone would be viewed as a significant accomplishment.  But it’s all the work you’ve done for years to try to get us there.  This law is not the end of our efforts, though.  That’s why, when And It’s one thing to pass the American Rescue Plan.  It’s going to be another thing to implement it.  It’s going to require fastidious oversight to make sure there’s no waste or fraud, and the law does what it’s designed to do.  And So there’s a lot of work for all of us left to do, but To every American watching: Help is here, and we will not stop working for you.  Together, with you, we are showing it’s possible to get big, important things done.  That’s what America does.  It tackles hard problems.  And how we do — you know, look, it’s how we do have it within ourselves to come out of this moment, which we’ve been saying — a lot of us have been saying for a long time, more prosperous, more united, and stronger than we went in.  That’s where we have a chance to be.  That’s what we’re going to be able to do.   And it’s really critical — and it’s really critical to demonstrate not Democrat/Republican; it’s critical to demonstrate that government can function — can function and deliver prosperity, security, and opportunity for the people in this country.   And as my grandfather used to kiddingly say, “With the grace of God, the goodwill of the neighbors, and the crick not rising,” that’s exactly what we’re going to do.   God bless you all.  Thanks for all you did.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you.      3:00 P.M.         8:32 A.M.  The Quad group is — was created in the wake of, as you just — everyone just saw on that short film — in the wake of a crisis under my predecessor, George W. Bush, on the 204 — the 2004 tsunami.    And for the first time, we’re convening this group as — at a leader level.  And  The — it’s also the first multilateral summit that I’ve had the opportunity to host as President.  And on this — and on this moment, it’s a purpose that  The United States is committed to working with you, our partners, and all our allies in the region to achieve stability.  And this is a group of — particularly important because it’s dedicated to the practical solutions and concrete results.   And, my counterparts, if you’ll forgive me, I’d like to give one example of why it matters.  There are many examples, but, yesterday,  Consequently, this week, the  But to get this right, we all have to focus on generating domestic demand and driving sustainable global growth.  And we’ve launching an ambitious new joint partnership that is going to boost vaccine manufacturing, and — for the global benefit — and strengthen vaccinations to benefit the entire Indo-Pacific.   We’re establishing a new mechanism to enhance our cooperation and raise our mutual ambitions as we address accelerating climate change.   And — and we’re renewing our commitment to ensure that our region is governed by international law, committed to upholding universal values, and free from coercion.    We’ve got a big agenda ahead of us, gentlemen, as you well know, but I’m optimistic about our prospects.  The Quad is going to be a vital arena for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.  And  And now, Prime Minister Modi, I’m kicking it over to you.  And again, it’s great to see you.   Excellencies, we are united by our democratic values and our commitment to a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific.  Our agenda today — covering areas like vaccines, climate change, and emerging technologies — make the Quad a force for global good.   Today’s summit meeting shows that Quad had come of age.  It will now remain an important pillar of stability in the region.  Thank you.     As we begin a new day here in Australia, it’s not yet dawn.  But we join together as Quad leaders of nations to welcome what  History teaches us that when nations engage together in a partnership of strategic trust, of common hope, and shared values, much can be achieved.  When the world emerged from the Great War and our last global pandemic a century ago, it soon found a Great Depression and another global conflict that unleashed a poverty and a devastation that was unthinkable.   As we emerge from this global pandemic and the global recession, let us together create a different future.  It is the Indo-Pacific that will now shape the destiny of our world in the 21st century.   As four leaders of great, liberal democracies in the Indo-Pacific, let our partnership be the enabler of peace, stability, and prosperity, and to do so inclusively with the many nations of our region to share in their vision, as expressed through ASEAN, for an open, inclusive — inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific; to respect and support their sovereignty, independence, and security by upholding our values and supporting international law; and to address the many challenges we face, from  Know, friends, that Australia, while looking to our friends in all of these tasks, we never leave it to our friends.  We’ll do our share of the heavy lifting to lighten the burden for us all.   I’m delighted to now hand over to my good friend, Yoshi, Prime Minister Suga.   Starting with the response to the tsunami disaster that we just saw on the video, the Quad four countries transformed into a forum for diplomatic dialogue in 2007.   Since then, after overcoming some difficult circumstances from around 2017, we gained a fresh momentum.  In October, last year, we reached the stage of holding the foreign ministers meeting here in Tokyo.  Less than half a year since then, we are now holding this first leaders’ summit.  And  With the four countries working together,  Yesterday was the 10th anniversary of the Great East Japan Earthquake.  We received massive support from the U.S., Australia, and India in our response to the disaster.  Joe visited the affected areas soon after the disaster.  And   8:44 A.M.         8:01 P.M.  Tonight, I’d like to talk to you about where we are as we mark one year since everything stopped because of this pandemic.   Denials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness.  Photos and videos from 2019 feel like they were taken in another era. The last vacation. The last birthday with friends. The last holiday with the extended family.  While it was different for everyone, we all lost something.   But, in the loss, we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect, and gratitude.  Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do. In fact, it may be the most American thing we do.  And that’s what we’ve done.  We’ve seen frontline and essential workers risking their lives — sometimes losing them — to save and help others. Researchers and scientists racing for a vaccine. And so many of you, as Hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places.   As I’ve told you before,  They were husbands, wives, sons and daughters, grandparents, friends, neighbors — young and old. They leave behind loved ones unable to truly grieve or to heal, even to have a funeral.  But I’m also thinking about everyone else who lost this past year to natural causes, by cruel fate of accident, or other diseases. They, too, died alone. They, too, leave loved ones behind who are hurting badly.  You know, you’ve often heard me say before,  So many of you have had to make that same walk this past year.  You lost your job. You closed your business. Facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, a loss of control, and, maybe worst of all, a loss of hope.  Watching a generation of children who may be set back up to a year or more — because they’ve not been in school — because of their loss of learning.  It’s the details of life that matter most, and we’ve missed those details.  The big details and small moments.  Weddings, birthdays, graduations — all the things that needed to happen but didn’t. The first date. The family reunions. The Sunday night rituals.  It’s all has exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us. For we are fundamentally a people who want to be with others — to talk, to laugh, to hug, to hold one another.  But this virus has kept us apart.  Grandparents haven’t seen their children or grandchildren. Parents haven’t seen their kids. Kids haven’t seen their friends.  The things we used to do that always filled us with joy have become the things we couldn’t do and broke our hearts.  Too often, we’ve turned against one another.   States pitted against one other instead of working with each other.  Vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans, who have been attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated. At this very moment, so many of them — our fellow Americans — they’re on the frontlines of this pandemic, trying to save lives, and still — still — they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It’s wrong, it’s un-American, and it must stop.  Look, we know what we need to do to beat this virus: Tell the truth. Follow the scientists and the science. Work together. Put trust and faith in our government to fulfill its most important function, which is protecting the American people — no function more important.  We need to remember the government isn’t some foreign force in a distant capital. No, it’s us. All of us. “We the People.” For you and I, that America thrives when we give our hearts, when we turn our hands to common purpose. And right now, my friends, we are doing just that. And  Last summer,  My fellow Americans, you’re owed nothing less than the truth.  And for all of you asking when things will get back to normal, here is the truth: The only way to get our lives back, to get our economy back on track is to beat the virus.  You’ve been hearing me say that for — while  That’s why I’m using every power  And thank God we’re making some real progress now.  On my first full day in office,  Two months ago, the country — this country didn’t have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or near all of the American public. But soon we will.  We’ve been working with the vaccine manufacturers — Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson — to manufacture and purchase hundreds of millions of doses of these three safe, effective vaccines. And now, at the direction and with the assistance of my administration, Johnson & Johnson is working together with a competitor, Merck, to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is one shot.  In fact, just yesterday,  It’s truly a national effort, just like we saw during World War II.  Now because of all the work we’ve done, we’ll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in America by the end of May. That’s months ahead of schedule.  And we’re mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in one’s arm. Calling on active duty military, FEMA, retired doctors and nurses, administrators, and those to administer the shots.  And we’ve been creating more places to get the shots. We’ve made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one — any one of nearly 10,000 pharmacies across the country, just like you get your flu shot.  We’re also working with governors and mayors, in red states and blue states, to set up and support nearly 600 federally supported vaccination centers that administer hundreds of thousands of shots per day. You can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot, get your shot, never leave your car, and drive home in less than an hour.  We’ve been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers all across America, located in underserved areas. And we’ve been deploying and we will deploy more mobile vehicles and pop-up clinics to meet you where you live so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get it.  We continue to work on making at-home testing available.  And we’ve been focused on serving people in the hardest-hit communities of this pandemic — Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities.  So, what does all this add up to? When  With new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the  When  Now  First, tonight, I’m announcing that  Let me say that again: All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. That’s much earlier than expected.  Let me be clear: That doesn’t mean everyone’s going to have that shot immediately, but it means you’ll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot.  To do this, we’re going to go from a million shots a day that  Secondly, at the time when every adult is eligible in May, we will launch, with our partners, new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot, including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you. No more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones.  Thirdly, with the passage of the American Rescue Plan — and  Fourth, in the coming weeks, we will issue further guidance on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated, to lessen the confusion, to keep people safe, and encourage more people to get vaccinated.  And finally, fifth, and maybe most importantly:   Because here’s the point: If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there’s a good chance you, your families, and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbeque and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn’t mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together.  After this long hard year, that will make this Independence Day something truly special, where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.  But to get there, we can’t let our guard down.  This fight is far from order — from over. As   The scientists have made clear that things may get worse again as new variants of the virus spread.  And we’ve got work to do to ensure everyone has confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccines.  So my message to you is this: Listen to Dr. Fauci, one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world. He has assured us the vaccines are safe. They underwent rigorous scientific review.  Talk to your family, your friends, your neighbors — the people you know best who’ve gotten the vaccine.  We need everyone to get vaccinated. We need everyone to keep washing their hands, stay socially distanced, and keep wearing the masks as recommended by the CDC.  Because even if we devote every resource we have, beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity.  And national unity isn’t just how politics and politicians vote in Washington or what the loudest voices say on cable or online. Unity is what we do together as fellow Americans. Because if we don’t stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. And, please, we don’t want to do again.  We’ve made so much progress. This is not the time to let up. Just as we are emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules.  I’ll close with this.  We’ve lost so much over the last year.  We’ve lost family and friends.  We’ve lost businesses and dreams we spent years building.  We’ve lost time — time with each other.  And our children have lost so much time with their friends, time with their schools. No graduation ceremonies this — this spring. No graduations from college, high school, moving-up ceremonies.  You know, and there’s something else we lost.  We lost faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American people.  But as  The development, manufacture, and distribution of the vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science. It is one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished.  And we also just saw the Perseverance rover land on Mars. Stunning images of our dreams that are now a reality. Another example of the extraordinary American ingenuity, commitment, and belief in science and one another.  And today,  It extends unemployment benefits. It helps small businesses. It lowers healthcare premiums for many. It provides food and nutrition, keeps families in their homes. And it will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts. And it fi- — and it funds all the steps I’ve just described to beat the virus and create millions of jobs.  In the coming weeks and months, I’ll be traveling, along with the First Lady, the Vice President, the Second Gentleman and members of my Cabinet, to speak directly to you, to tell you the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meets the moment. And if it fails at any pa-,  About how after a long, dark years — one whole year, there is hope and light of better days ahead.  If we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school, and we will have proven once again that this country can do anything — hard things, big things, important things.  Over a year ago, no one could’ve imagined what we were about to go through, but now we’re coming through it, and it’s a shared experience that binds us together as a nation. We are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by. But we’re also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of us.  My fervent prayer for our country is that, after all we have been through, we’ll come together as one people, one nation, one America.    This is the United States of America, and there is nothing — nothing — from the bottom of my heart,  So God bless you all.  And please, God, give solace to all those people who lost someone.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you for taking the time to listen.   8:27 P.M.         3:43 P.M.  MR. FRAZIER:  Right.      We’d ride back and forth on Amtrak.  You lived in Philadelphia;  And  Today, we’re seeing two health companies — competitors — each with over 130 years of experience, coming together to help write a more hopeful chapter in our battle against COVID-19.   You know, what’s clear is this is a historic, nearly unprecedented collaboration.  During World War Two, one of the country’s slogans was “We are all in this together.”  “We are all in this together.”  And companies took that slogan to heart.  For example, when one automaker didn’t have the capacity to build enough jeeps, so a competitor stepped in to help.  Competing airline makers teamed up, and they produced parts for each other and gave the American pilots, as a consequence of that, control of the skies.  Today, we’re seeing the same type of collaboration when it comes to getting this virus under control.   Your companies have been working closely with a man you’ve both privately, on the way over, bragged about: Jeff Zients.  Jeff is in the front row here.   You know, when we came into office, we began working with the team at J&  The result is that we’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every American adult by the end of May — months earlier than anyone expected.  And today,    Well, there’s millions of people who are going to feel that way and be proud to have — be in a position that they ha- — an ability to get the kind of help they need.  Seven weeks ago, only 8 percent of the seniors — those most vulnerable to COVID-19 — had received the vaccination.  Today, 60 percent of the people over the age of 65 or older have received at least one shot.  And that’s because this is the population that represents 80 percent of the COVID-19 deaths.   We’ve opened — we’ve opened support and opened — excuse me — and supported more than 500 community vaccination sites.  That’s more — and they’re administrating hundreds of thousands of shots a day.   And for folks who aren’t near a pharmacy or mass vaccination center, we’re deploying mobile clinics, like vans, that go into places to meet the folks where they live.  We’re also supplying vaccines to community health centers to reach those who have been hit the hardest and suffered the most, especially black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities.  And this is important because we know we have more to do to ensure everyone is treated with equity and those most impacted get the care they deserve.  On Saturday, we hit a record of 2.9 million vaccinations in one day in America.  And beyond the numbers are the stories: a father who says he no longer fears for his daughter when she leaves to go to work at the hospital; the children who are now able to hug their grandparents.  The vaccines bring hope and healing in so many ways.   Again, a vaccinated American is the only way to beat the pandemic, get our economy back on track, and for us to get back our lives and our loved ones.   You know, that’s why the American Rescue Plan was so critical.   This bill represents a historic — historic victory for the American people.   Everything in the American Rescue Plan addresses a real need, including investments to fund our entire vaccination effort: more vaccines, more vaccinators, and more vaccinations sites.  Millions more Americans will get tested, including home testing.  Schools will soon have the funding and resources to reopen safely — a national imperative.  The American Rescue Plan, the partnership between Johnson & Johnson and Merck, proves we can do big things, important things in this country.   Now, I’ll — let me conclude with this: Tomorrow night, I’m going on primetime to address the American people and talk about what we went through as a nation this past year.  But more importantly, I’m going to talk about what comes next.  I’m going to launch the next phase of the  There is light at the end of this dark tunnel of the past year, but we cannot let our guard down now or assume that victory is inevitable.  Together, we’re going to get through this pandemic and usher in a healthier and more hopeful future.  So there is real reason for hope, folks.  There’s real reason for hope,  May God bless you all.  May God protect our troops.  And may God ease the pain in the heart of so many who have lost so many people in this pandemic.   Thank you, and  3:53 P.M.        Washington, D.C.  12:25 P.M.   Hey, everybody.  How are you?  PARTICIPANTS:  Hi!    It’s good to see you.  MR. SIEGEL:  We are — we are D.C.’s oldest hardware store.  We’ve been continuously operating in this city since 1866.  We’ve moved around a few times.  We’ve been in this building for seven years now.  Like my father was telling you, this is actually our second presidential visit, but our first one in this building.  So, welcome.  We’re excited to have you here today.  We want to introduce you to Mary Ackley, from Little Wild Things.  She has a separate business in our building.  What they do is microgreens.  And I’ll turn it over to Mary because she can describe her business a lot better than I’ll be able to.    Fire away, Mary.  MS. ACKLEY:  Sure.  We moved here a few years ago, and we are an urban vertical farm located right next door.  We grow salad greens, microgreens, and edible flowers.  Beautiful salads.  We deliver them all over the greater Washington, D.C., area, both to homes and we donate locally here in the neighborhood.    Now, you’ve been engaged in the neighborhood too.  You sponsor a Little League team, don’t you?  MR. SIEGEL:  We do.  We sponsor a Little League team.  We also — we run job fairs for special needs programs to get their students — to help them find employment.  We’ve actually hired three people from those — from that job program.  It’s called “Project SEARCH.”  It’s a partnership between a nonprofit and the D.C. government, and they do a great job training their students, who are special needs, to come and be able to work in an environment like this and be great contributors.    Have you hired any of those folks?   MR. SIEGEL:  We’ve hired three.    Three?  MR. SIEGEL:  Yes.     I’ll be darned.  MR. SIEGEL:  And Mary participated in our first job fair.  We were going to do another one but, obviously, the pandemic has halted our ability to do that.  But when things go back to normal, we’re going to continue to do the job fairs.    Tell me, what kind of — what — what hit you the hardest when the pandemic hit?  MR. SIEGEL:  Right.  So the biggest challenge is what were we going to do with our staff.  You know, there were so many uncertainties related to what the virus actually did.  The first thing that we did was we took all of our at-risk employees and we sent them home, and we paid them through that entire process.   That first wave of You know, and we’re still — we’re still struggling because we did — a lot of retail business has actually increased over the course of the pandemic.    Well, one of the reasons why And we found out that an awful lot of that went to big — bigger businesses that, in fact, weren’t supposed to qualify for this.  Because they — there used be a thing called an “inspector general” to see where the money went.  And the last administration fired the inspector general, so a lot of money went to people who shouldn’t have gotten help, and it didn’t go to folks who —  But, you know, the significance with this new program — and we’re going to continue this, by the way — it’s not only —  only businesses with fewer than 20 folks could apply for the last couple weeks.  But now we’re going to keep the focus on it because there’s a lot of minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses are increased significantly by 20, 15 — 20 and 15 percent, as well as getting people who, in fact, weren’t able to get in line before.  And it’s hard to know how to get in line.   And so MR. SIEGEL:  Yeah, One quick point   MR. SIEGEL:  Yes.  PARTICIPANTS:  Hi!  MR. SIEGEL:  Yes, and then we also have solar panels —    Don’t jump; we need you.     12:31 P.M.         4:27 P.M.  On Friday,  qualified warriors and patriots.  General Jacqueline Van Ovost in the United States Air Force is currently the only female four-star officer serving in our military.   And when confirmed, the Lieutenant General Laura Richardson, of the United States Army, will be promoted in rank and join General Van Ovost as the only four-star — as another four-star general.   And, when confirmed, they will become the second and third women in the history of the United States Armed Forces to lead combatant commands.  Each of these women have led careers demonstrating incomparable skill, integrity, and duty to country.  And at every step, they’ve also helped push open the doors of opportunity to women in our military — blazing the trail a little wider, a little brighter for all the proud women following in their path and looking to their example.   And  Today is International Women’s Day.  And we all need to see and to recognize the barrier-breaking accomplishments of these women.  We need the young women just beginning their careers in the military service to see it and know that no door will be closed to them.  We need women and men throughout the ranks to see and celebrate women’s accomplishments and leadership in the services.  We need little girls and boys both, who have grown up dreaming of serving for their country, to know this is what generals in the United States Armed Forces look like.  This is what Vice Presidents of United States look like.   So I’d like to spend just a few minutes today making sure that America knows who General Van Ovost is and Lieutenant General Richardson is.  They’re aviators.  Both learned to fly planes before they were old enough to drive a car.   General Van Ovost, a first-generation — is a first-generation American: the daughter of Dutch immigrants who owned a flying operation.  She loved the freedom of flight and, as a teenager, flew herself to see Sally Ride lift off as the first woman in space.  Sixteen years old, goes down to see Sally Ride.  She said she was at several thousand feet watching from a distance.   You know, women weren’t — were banned from flying combat missions when the General joined the force, so she focused on becoming a test pilot.  And instead of learning to fly just one plane, she learned to fly everything, including Air Force Two when  General Van Ovost currently is — oversees Air Mobility Command: approximately 107,000 airmen and 1,100 planes that enable America’s air power and humanitarian assistance to go everywhere in the world it need be.  From flying water to Texans after the recent storms, to ensuring our wounded warriors are evacuated for medical care from anywhere in the world, she gets it done.   Lieutenant General Richardson’s parents were proud patriots.  It must have rubbed off because Lieutenant General Richardson and her brother and sister all joined the Army.  Her father encouraged her to join  When Lieutenant General Richardson joined the Army Aviation Branch, women were banned from flying attack helicopters.  She flew to — in support of combatant — combat missions, and conducting lift operations of her UH-1 — the so-called “Huey” — and the Blackhawks.   Now, as a commanding general of the United States Army North, Lieutenant General Richardson oversees military ground responses here in North America all over — all over the last year.  That’s meant getting military and medical personnel deployed to help in our response to this pandemic.  More than 4,500 military and medical personnel deployed in hospitals across 14 states and the Navajo Nation to treat COVID-19 patients.  It means more than 2,200 medical personnel are working, or soon will be, at vaccination sites in eight states and the United States Virgin Islands.   I’m so proud of the incredible work Lieutenant General Richardson and her team have done to support the American people this year, and the American people are as well.  They’re warriors.  They’re crisis-tested commanders.   But best of all — but best of all, they’re not done yet.  Neither of these incredible generals is resting on her laurels or on her stars.  They’re using their voices and actively working to change policies in the military to make it easier and safer for more women not just to join the military, but to stay in the military and to thrive.   I’m incredibly proud that in 2015, under the Obama-Biden administration, we took the final steps to open up all positions in the military to anyone qualified to serve in them.  The women who join today’s military aren’t told “no” when they apply to fly fighter jets or attack helicopters just because of their gender.  They aren’t told “no” when they want to apply to Ranger School or infantry officer basic training.   But they all know that there’s much, much more work to be done to ensure that women’s leadership is recognized  and we have more diverse leaders; we reach the top echelons of command for all who are qualified, including all women — all women; and that all women feel safe and respected in our military — period.  You know, some of — some of it is relatively straightforward work where we’re making good progress designing body armor that fits women properly; tailoring combat uniforms for women; creating maternity flight suits; updating — updating requirements for their hairstyles.    And some of it is going to take — and — you know, an intensity of purpose and mission to really change the culture and habits that cause women to leave the military:   That women are — making sure more diverse candidates are considering — being considered for career-advancing opportunities at every single level.  That women aren’t penalized in their careers for having children.  That women aren’t just token members, but integral parts throughout all branches and all divisions.   And that they can completely, fairly engage in promotion and compete all across the board, including on the — on age and gender neutrality and the physical fitness test.  You know that both members of the — of the military couples can thrive while serving, like Lieutenant General Richardson and her husband, Lieutenant General Richardson, who,  And we have to take on sexual assault and harassment and violence against women in the military.  Sexual assault is a abhorrent and wrong at any time.  And in our military, where so much of unit cohesion is built on trusting your fellow service members to have your back, there’s nothing less than a threat to our national security.    This is going to be an all-hands-on-deck effort under my administration to end the scourge of sexual assault in the military.  And we’re going to be focused on that from the very top.   The U.S. Military has defeated American enemies on land, in air, and at sea, and this is not beyond us.    It’s my great honor to serve as your Commander-in-Chief.  And  So  Thank you all.  May God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you.   Thank you, everybody.      4:43 P.M.          Reverend Joseph Lowery, and Congressman John Lewis. Preachers of the social gospel. Architects of the ‘Beloved Community,’ they built not only with words but with action. And reminders that in our lifetime, for Black Americans, the fundamental right to vote has been denied by white supremacy hiding both behind white hoods and in plain sight in state houses and courtrooms.   Yet those torches and burning crosses, the batons, tear gas, fire hoses, attack dogs, and unfair laws and trials could not stop progress. The blood of John Lewis and hundreds of other brave and righteous souls that was spilled in Selma, on this Sunday in 1965 sanctified a noble struggle.   And when the country saw those images that night, America was forced to confront the denial of democracy — the fierce urgency of justice.   Congress passed the Voting Rights Act a few months later, and President Johnson signed it into law.   The legacy of the march in Selma is that while nothing can stop a free people from exercising their most sacred power as a citizen, there are those who will do everything they can to take that power away.   The Voting Rights Act began to dismantle barriers to voting and to make our elections more fair, free, and representative.     Then in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, holding that times have changed and blatant voter discrimination was rare, contrary to the assault that was taking place on the ground. The late Justice Ginsburg wrote that the decision was like “throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm.” Today, we have a hail storm, not a rain storm.   And in 2020, our very democracy on the line, even in the midst of a pandemic, more Americans voted than ever before. Multiple recounts in states and decisions in more than 60 courts – from judges appointed by my predecessor, including at the Supreme Court – upheld the integrity of this historic election.   Yet instead of celebrating this powerful demonstration of voting – we have seen an unprecedented insurrection in our Capitol and a brutal attack on our democracy on January 6th.   And to think that it’s been followed by an all-out assault on the right to vote in state legislatures all across the country happening right now. During the current legislative session, elected officials in 43 states have already introduced more than 250 bills to make it harder for Americans to vote. We cannot let them succeed.   Last week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2021. This is a landmark piece of legislation that is urgently needed to protect the right to vote, the integrity of our elections, and to repair and strengthen our democracy.     Today, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday,   I’ll close with this – a few days before he passed, Jill and   But instead of answering our concerns about him, “how are you doing, John,” he asked us to stay focused on the work left undone to heal and to unite this nation around what it means to be an American.   That’s the God’s truth. John wouldn’t talk about his pending death or his concerns. He said we just got to get this done.   That we are all created equal. That we all deserve to be treated equally.   On this day of reflection, please, let’s stay focused on the work ahead.   Let’s remember all those who came before us as a bridge to our history so we do not forget its pain, and as a bridge to our future so we never lose our hope.   May God bless their memory. May God bless you all.  ###           2:05 P.M.   Also,  Chuck Schumer — Senator Chuck Schumer, when the country needed you most, you led, Chuck, and you delivered.  Neither  For — for over a year, the American people were told they were on their own.  They were seeing — we’ve seen how hard that has been on so many Americans.  As of last night, 519,064 lives lost to the virus.  That many empty chairs this morning — the breakfast table — gone.  More than four hundred [thousand] small businesses closed unnecessarily.  Millions of people out of work through no fault of their own.   This nation has suffered too much for much too long.  And everything in this package is designed to relieve the suffering and to meet the most urgent needs of the nation and put us in a better position to prevail, starting with beating this virus and vaccinating the country.   The resources in this plan will be used to expand and speed up manufacturing and distribution of vaccines so we can get every single American vaccinated sooner than later.   Because of all the funding, we’ll be able to hire more vaccinators, set up more vaccination sites to get the country in a place to get back to normal.  This plan will get checks out the door, starting this month, to the American people who so desperately need the help, many of whom are lying in bed at night, staring at the ceiling, wondering, “Will  Over 85 percent of American households will get direct payments of $1,400 per person.  For a typical middle-class family of four — husband and wife working, making $100,000 a year total, with three kids — they’ll get $5,600 —  That means the mortgage can get paid.  That means the child can stay in community college.  That means maintaining the health insurance you have.  It’s going to make a big difference  in so many of lives in this country.       Unemployment benefits will be extended for 11 million Americans who have lost their jobs and who, last night, again were lying in bed, just thinking, “My lord, I’m going to lose my unemployment insurance in a week or so.”  It was about to expire.       Schools are going to have the resources they need to open safely.  States and local governments that have lost tens of thousands of essential workers will be — have the resources they need available to them, to those laid-off police officers, firefighters, teachers, and nurses they can rehire.  These are essential personnel.  Look, the American Rescue Plan lowers healthcare premiums.  Food and nutrition assistance.  It’s hard to believe that 24 million adults and 11 million children, as  This helps families who are behind on their rent and their mortgage payments so they aren’t thrown out of their homes.   Look, the bottom line is this:  This plan puts us  on the path to beating the virus.  This plan gives those  families who are struggling the most the help and the breathing room they need to get through this moment.  This plan gives small businesses in this country a fighting chance to survive.  And one more thing: This plan is historic.  Taken altogether, this plan is going to make it possible to cut child poverty in half.  Let me say that again — it’s significant, historic: It will cut child poverty in half.  There’s much more to this bill, but, for now, let me make one final point.  When  And, you know, it may sound strange, but a lot of senators and congressmen  And now this bill returns to the House of Representatives, which has done a great job from the beginning, where  By passing the American Rescue Plan, we’ll have heeded the voice of the American people, not ignored their voices.  By passing this plan, we will have delivered real, tangible results for the American people and their families, and they’ll be able to see and know and feel the change in their own lives.  And by passing this plan, we’ll have proved that this government, this democracy can still work.  What has to be done — it’ll improve people’s lives.    And one more thing: The vast majority of economists — left, right, and center — from Wall Street to the — to the private — private economic polling initiatives — the economists — as I’ve said, left, right, and center — say, “In addition to the needs the people have, we need this to grow the economy.”  That if we haven’t spent this money and recreated the kind of incentive for people to be able to make a good living, that we’d be in real trouble.   This will create millions of new jobs — it’s estimated over 6 million new jobs by itself; increase the Gross Domestic Product by a trillion dollars; put our nation in a position to out-compete the rest of the world — because the rest of the world is moving, particularly China; and to know that as tough as this moment is, there are brighter days ahead.  There really are.   As I’ve said before, it’s never a good bet to bet against America.  It’s never been a good bet to bet against the American people.  We are America.  We’re going to get there.  We’re going to remain the leading economy in the world and going to be the most successful economy in the world because of you, the American people.  Thank you, and God bless you all.  May God protect our troops.  Thank you.     They’re going to be good.  I’m going to succeed.  We’re going to succeed moving forward.  Look, the American people strongly support what we’re doing.  That’s the key here.  And that’s going to continue to seep down through the public, including from our Republican friends.  There’s a lot of Republicans who came very close.  They’ve got a lot of pressure on them.   Thank you.               Pardon?               They’re not frustrated.  Bernie Sanders said this is the most progressive bill he’s ever seen passed since he’s been here.  And the compromises were all compromises that didn’t affect the substance and the essence of what the bill is.  Going from $300 — from $400 to $300, to the unemployment excess.  Well, it got extended until September.  The end result is the essentially about the same.  And so,       Thank you.  2:14 P.M.         3:25 P.M.   And  And people in the country are hurting right now, with less than two weeks from enhanced unemployment checks being cut out.  And 7 million kids don’t have enough food; 13 million people are behind in their rent.  And the American Rescue Plan,  And  That isn’t some academic discussion.  It’s about you; it’s about people like you and the families  And so, as — again, this isn’t an academic discussion.  You deserve our thanks and our support.  And I’m going to hand it back to Cedric so we can hear from you all while the press is still in here.  MR. RICHMOND:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  Today we’re joined by three outstanding Americans that exemplify what America stands for, and especially your values, which is service to others.   And, first, we have Ms. Alma Williams.  Ms. Williams is a paratransit driver.  She transports disabled Americans every day.  She has four wonderful children, and her youngest is in the process of applying to college.  The other two are in college, and one is on her way.  So Ms. Williams is close to being a empty nester.  Then we have George Kerr, who served in the United States Navy for almost eight years; served on two Air Force carriers. And he volunteers but also is starting a nonprofit small business to help people with substance use issues and health and home effects.  And he has — which you mentioned earlier — the unfortunate experience of having a house that burned down.  And  And then we have Ms. Lyda Vanegas, who volunteers at a D.C. community health center and spends her time counseling and helping Americans get through this very rough time.  And she has seen the effects, firsthand, of the challenges and the pain and the suffering that American citizens are going through, which is particularly important that you say “through no fault of their own.”   And with that, Mr. President, I’m going to turn it back over to — now we’ll turn it over to Ms. Williams so that she can tell us about what she thinks about the American Rescue Plan.  MS. WILLIAMS:  It actually is a wonderful plan.  As well as being a paratransit operator, I’m also union rep for the ATU.     ATU.  MS. WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.  And, you know, just hearing the things that, you know, my coworkers go through is devastating.  You know, we’re fighting to work a maximum of less than 40 hours a week, you know?  And as   And you’re still employed?  MS. WILLIAMS:  Yes.  You know?  And it’s just a hard time financially, mentally, emotionally — like, across the board for children, adults.  You know?  And it’s just —   MS. WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.    I’d like to talk more about this, if MR. RICHMOND:  Thank you, Mr. President.  With that, we’ll turn it over to you, Mr. Kerr.   MR. KERR:  Well, once again, thank you for having me.  It’s really important that we’re having this conversation.  I’m in full support of this piece of important legislation.   As you said, And being an And so And at the same time, my community — the   So am I.   MR. KERR:  Thank you.  MR. RICHMOND:  And last, but certainly not least, is Ms. Lyda Vanegas.  MS. VANEGAS:  Well, first of all, thank you so much.  Thank you for allowing Mary’s Center — you know, on behalf of Mary’s Center, being me here, you know, to share this story of the many, many families that we have served during this pandemic.   You know, for those of you who don’t know Mary’s Center, we are a community health center.  We’re a Federally Qualified Health Center, and we serve over 60,000 families in the D.C. region.  So we have been in service for 33 years.  I’ve been with Mary’s Center for 19 years.  And The beauty of Mary’s Center, the way It’s interesting, So far, we have done more than 20,000 And so we received the vaccine back in December.  We have vaccinated twelve — around 1,200 fam- — individuals.  But if you put it in perspective, serving 60,000 participants — and let’s say 50 percent are adults over 18 that can get the vaccine — so we still have like almost 30,000 people that still need the vaccine.  But we know, Mr. President, that that will multiply in a few weeks because we — we’re trustful that, you know, you will deliver on the promise of vaccinating 100 million people soon.  Right?   And so, you know, if you ask me what our families have gone through, they have gone through everything.  You know, just by hearing Alma’s and George’s stories, it just — it just breaks my heart because this is the same situation: They’re losing jobs.  That’s the main thing; you know that.  And with that, they have unstable housing, food insecurity.  They’re traveling long distances to go and visit the site — the food distribution site, and that’s every day.  Then they do long lines.  And next day, they have to do the same.   And so it’s been hard.  And because they haven’t been able to pay rent, now they’re moving with other people to live together.  And so they’re sleeping on couches, on the floor.  They’re always at risk of being infected.  And because they have lost jobs — a few of them have kept their jobs, but few hours — but they still need to go outside.  So when they go, they’re at risk of being infected, and then they come back and they have the family.  Right?   So, you know, it’s this circle of situations that have been impacting all of our families.  So, you know, with that comes mental health, trauma, anxiety.  And our children don’t have laptops.  We have been able to distribute about 1,000 laptops or more.  But, you know, if they have one laptop, but they have three children, how can they all be in school on the same day?  So they have to choose.  Or they don’t have Internet connection.  So there’s a lot around that, and we’ve been trying to support as much as possible.    Well, thank you for — all of you for what you do.  As of today, 517,224 — not over 500,000; 517,224.  And we will meet the 100 million shots.  We’re up to 82,572,848 shots.  We’re going to get this done.   I’m going to ask some questions now.  The press is going to leave, and I’m going to get more personal with you, if 3:37 P.M.         2:25 P.M.   All right.  We’re about to have an economic meeting, but Today’s jobs report shows that the American Rescue Plan is urgently needed, in our view.  Now, our economy still has 9.5 million fewer jobs than it had this time last year.  And at that rate, it would take two years to get us back on track.  We have 1 million fewer educators — 1 million fewer educators — than we did this time last year.  We’ve lost 400,000 small businesses.  All of those empty storefronts aren’t just shattered dreams, they’re warning lights that are going off and state and local budgets that are being stretched because of the lack of tax revenue.  And some of last month’s job growth is a result of the December relief package.  But without a rescue plan, these gains are going to slow.  We can’t afford one step forward and two steps backwards.  We need to beat the virus, provide essential relief, and build an inclusive recovery.   People need the help now.  In less than two weeks, enhanced unemployment benefits will begin to expire for 11 million people.  At least 7 million kids don’t have enough food to eat on a regular basis.  Thirteen million people are behind in their rent.   And the rescue plan is absolutely essential for turning this around, getting kids back to school safely, getting a lifeline to small business, and getting the upper hand on COVID-19.  That’s what we’re going to be talking about now.   So 2:27 P.M.        Roosevelt Room  5:04 P.M.   Yes.  DR. WATKINS:  This is Mike Watkins at JPL.    Hey, Mike.  How are ya?  DR. WATKINS:    DR. WATKINS:  We thank you for that, and we appreciate that.  And it’s our honor to be given these kinds of tasks; it’s what we live for.  And so you may see here I’m surrounded by a few hundred of my best friends in this and a couple of other control rooms and online.  You know, these are really big team efforts, and it’s important to us to get as much of the team to join with us today as we could.  And we really appreciate your time.    Appreciate it.  I’m flattered you’d take the time to let me talk to you.  DR. WATKINS:  Well, we would love to have you out here someday.  In fact, I’ve got two badges for you and the Vice President.  So when   I’ll be happy to do that.  I’ll be happy to do that.  Am DR. WATKINS:  Thanks.  We would love it.  You know, one of the things   Yeah.  DR. WATKINS:  And, you know, that was a great opportunity, you know, for us to show,   That’s right.  DR. WATKINS:  And   Yep.  DR. WATKINS:  — after having watched that.  And it’s something we — you know, it’s very important to us.  It’s a major part of what we do here at   It’s incredible talent.  Now, am DR. WATKINS:  So, either way — any way you’d like to do it is fine.  We have Dr. Mohan here with me.  She — of course, you know her from the landing coverage.  But —    Hey, Doc.  How are you?  DR. MOHAN:  I’m doing very well, Mr. President.  Thank you for —    DR. MOHAN:  — for taking the time to speak with us.    Are you kidding me?  What an honor this is.  This is an incredible honor.  And it’s amazing.  Indian — of descent — Americans are taking over the country: you; my Vice President; my speechwriter, Vinay.  Did you want to say something?  I’ll be quiet.  DR. WATKINS:  Absolutely.  You know, tell us how you felt on landing day and, actually, what path brought you to here at the lab.  DR. MOHAN:  Absolutely.  So my path actually started way back when You know, Perseverance is my first mission at You know, those last days and weeks leading up to landing day, it was pretty smooth, but we were all still really nervous and, frankly, terrified until we got through those final seven minutes.  To be able to call “touchdown” safely, to see those first images come back from Mars, to see the place where we have never been able to go to on Mars before and go there — reach there for the express purpose of seeking out new life just made it feel like Now that that tremendous relief has passed for the team of being able to be there safely, all that’s left is the excitement and the thrill of all the scientific discoveries that are yet to come and what Perseverance can actually find — and hopefully find those signs of past life on Mars.     Well, They were beginning to wonder about us.  They were beginning to wonder: Are we still the country we always believed we were?  You guys did it.  You guys gave a sense of “America is back.”  It‘s — it’s astounding what you did.  You should not underestimate it.  You should not underestimate it.  You know, you did it the most American way: You believed in science, you believed in hard work, and you believed there wasn’t a darn thing you couldn’t do if you put your minds together.  One of the reasons why we’re such an incredible country is we’re such a diverse country.  We bring the best out of every single solitary culture in the world here in the United States of America, and we give people an opportunity to let their — let their dreams run forward.   And you just — I’m not being — look, I’m not — And America’s image in the world — and it matters.  It matters because democracies have to demonstrate they can run as efficiently and more efficiently than autocracies.  There’s a big battle going on.  Your kids are going to be studying about when democracy once again reestablished it could do anything, as opposed to autocracies that can just command things.  We can land a rover on Mars.  We can beat a pandemic.  And with science, hope, and vision, there’s not a damn thing we can’t do as a country.  We have never, ever, ever failed to meet a goal.  We’ve set our mind to it, and we’ve done it together.  And that’s what you all showed.  So it goes way beyond — way beyond the whole notion of what you just recently did.   And God only knows what is going to come from this.  God only knows what’s going to happen.  But you all are incredible.  All of the dreams you’ve created in other people’s minds — other young kids.   And so So, anyway, folks, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You’re great Americans, and you’ve demonstrated it again: There’s not a thing we cannot do when we set our mind to it.   God bless you all.  Thank you.  Thanks, Mike.  DR. WATKINS:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.    And by the way, I’m like a poor relative, Mike.  When I’m invited, DR. WATKINS:  We will —    They stay longer than they’re supposed to.  I’m one of those kind of guys.  DR. WATKINS:  Well, we will be more than happy to have you, and stay as long as you want.    I’m looking forward to seeing you all in person.  Thank you.  DR. WATKINS:  We’ll get you an office here.     Thank you.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Bye bye.  Godspeed.  DR. WATKINS:  Thank you, sir.    5:14 P.M.           Hey, everybody.   We’re going to talk about infrastructure and American competitiveness and what we’re going to do to make sure we once again lead the world across the board in infrastructure.  It’s a — it not only creates jobs, but it makes us a hell of a lot more competitive around the world if we have the best infrastructure in the world.  We’re going to be talking about that.   And     I’ve been talking to a lot of my Republican friends in the House and the Senate, and continue to do that.  And — and we have.  We’ve met — had a number of meetings with Republicans on the coronavirus bill and — House, Senate, and a combination of both.  So we’re keeping everybody informed.     Am     Yes.  Thank you.     I’m sorry.  Can’t hear him.  Thank you all for coming in.  Thank you.  2:20 P.M.           Nancy,  And  And you’re also very, very — which is important — you’re kind, but you’re tough.  And you know what’s right, and you stick by it.  And  And  And  You all showed, at a time when the American people are depending on us — and they are desperately in need of us — that a diverse caucus isn’t a divided caucus.   Congressman Clyburn,  Breonna Taylor and George Floyd were still alive.  California had yet to suffer the worst — the wor- — what would become the worst fire season in recorded history.  And there’d been no violent insurrection on Capitol Hill.  And  My point is this: In the year that has passed, all the challenge  And more than 400,000 businesses — mostly small business, many minority businesses — have been shuttered; cost millions of jobs.  1.3 million public sector — education, nurses, cops, firefighters, essential workers — have lost their jobs.  So my message today is really simple: You — you, this caucus, have shown the American people the difference Democratic leadership and what we just had.  Leadership makes a difference.  And you’re continuing to do so.   For example,  And here is why: You know, the confidence in the American — in the American government has been plummeting since the late ‘60s to what it is now.  And many of you remember that in 2009, we expended a lot of political capital — Nancy and  But we didn’t adequately explain what we had done.  Barack was so modest, he didn’t want to take, as he said, a “victory lap.”   And this is a case where every single piece of the bill you passed addresses a genuine, desperate need for the American people.  Each piece isn’t just defensible, it is urgent and overwhelmingly supported by the people.  It’s good policy and it’s good politics.  And I’m not sure we’ve ever seen something that is needed as badly as the American Rescue Plan that was as broadly popular.  Nancy and  Sir, I’ve served in the Congress for 36 years before becoming Vice President for 8.  We never had anything this urgent and this ambitious that was so widely embraced.  Three-quarters of the American are together with — on this.  Three quarters.  Nearly unanimous support among Democrats; more than 70 percent of independents.  In poll after poll, 60 percent of Republicans — I’ll say that again — 60 percent of Republicans support what we’re doing.   Look, the show of unity we’re seeing is unprecedented.  It isn’t just about the sum of the total package; Americans are in lockstep on each major element of the plan, and they know what they are.  They support what we’re doing on vaccines.  Look at the progress we’ve made with your help.  We’ve been able to move us to the point where we had very little supply, to we will have enough vaccine because of the work we’ve done with your help — enough vaccine by the end of May to be able to vaccinate every single adult in America.  It will not be done by then, but that supply will be there.   They support what we’re doing on direct payments, on unemployment insurance, on food and nutrition support, on keeping people in their homes, on safely reopening our schools.   Staying unified as we complete this process to pass the American Rescue Plan won’t just make a difference in our fight against COVID-19 and our efforts to rebuild the economy, it will also show the American people we’re capable of coming together for what matters most to them.  They’ve lost faith in government; this is a time to reestablish that faith.  And the reason why they should have faith is because we’re doing the right thing.  It’s a show of strength and a first step forward to restoring their faith in the capacity of government to have their backs.  And if we deliver on this, it also builds momentum.  It builds real mome- — enthusiasm as well.   And  And    So  And I’m happy to take questions if that’s what you — I’m supposed to do, Nance.  Whatever you want me to do.                         5:29 P.M.         1:50 P.M.  And the Vice President and  And probably to all of you, like all of us, cancer is personal for almost everybody.  It’s probably the one word that is the most frightening word in the English language to people.  When they hear that “ And  But there’s so much hope that that’s what  Thank you for coming in.  And we’re — I’m optimistic we’re going to get something done here.     We are following that through right now.  Thank God no one was killed by the rocket.  One individual, a contractor, died of a heart attack.  But we’re identifying who is responsible, and we’ll make judgments from that point.   Okay?  Thank you.          Texas —  We are on the cusp of being able to fundamentally change the nature of this disease because of the way in which we’re able to get vaccines in people’s arms.  We’ve been able to move that all the way up to the end of May to have enough for every American to get — every adult American to get a shot.  And the last thing — the last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that, in the meantime, everything is fine, take off your mask.   Forget it.  It still matters.    And  So thank you very much.  1:55 P.M.         4:22 P.M.  As you know, a few days ago, after a rigorous opening — open and objective scientific review process, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.  We should all be encouraged by this news of a third safe and highly effective COVID-19 vaccine.  The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we’re going to overcome this virus and get back to our loved ones, get our economy back on track, and start to move back to normal.  But that’s — one of my first goals in office was — when  As  As I’ve always said, this was a wartime effort, and every action has been on the table, including putting together breakthrough approaches.  And today, we’re announcing a major step forward: Two of the largest healthcare and pharmaceutical companies in the world — that are usually competitors — are working together on the vaccine.  Johnson & Johnson and Merck will work together to expand the production of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine.  This is the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War Two.   We also invoked the Defense Production Act to equip two Merck facilities to the standards necessary to safely manufacture the J& In addition, we’ll continue to use the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies.   I’ve also asked the Department of Defense to provide daily logistical support to strengthen Johnson & Johnson’s efforts.  And  Here’s what all this means: We’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May.   Let me say that again: When  And I’m pleased to announce today, as a consequence of the stepped-up process that I’ve ordered and just outlined, this country will have enough vaccine supply — I’ll say it again — for every adult in America by the end of May.  By the end of May.  That’s progress — important progress.   But it’s not enough to have the vaccine supply.  We need vaccinators — people to put the shots in people’s arms, millions of Americans’ arms.   To date, we’ve brought back retired doctors and nurses.  We’ve developed — we deployed more than 1,500 federal medical personnel you usually see during natural disasters, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency —  We’re also increasing the places where people can get vaccinated.  We’ve sent millions of vaccines to over 7,000 pharmacies to make it easier for folks to get their COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would their flu shot.   The federal government is also working with states to set up hundreds of mass vaccination centers in places like stadiums, community centers, parking lots that vaccinate thousands of people per day.  My wife Jill and  And with this increased production of three safe and effective vaccines, we have an opportunity to help address the urgent national need more quickly and getting our schools back open safely.    Right now, an entire generation of young people is on the brink of being set back a year or more in their learning.  You can ask millions of parents; they understand.  We’re already seeing rising mental health concerns due in part to isolation.    Educational disparities that have always existed grow wider each day that our schools remain closed.  And remote learning isn’t the same for every student, as you all know.  Our educators are doing everything they can to protect and educate our students, despite the lack of resources and as districts face budget crises that risk education jobs.  Moms and dads are exiting the workforce in astonishing numbers in order to care for and manage the school experience for their children at home, hindering their own opportunities for — and further undermining the health of our economy.   This is a national imperative that we get our kids back into the classroom safely and as soon as possible.  As you know, back in December,  To achieve that goal,  You know, also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, issued new guidelines on how to reopen schools safely.  It’s a roadmap that will enable schools — if they have the resources they deserve — to reopen safely.   Let me be clear: We can reopen schools if the right steps are taken, even before employees are vaccinated.  But time and again, we’ve heard from educators and parents that they have anxieties about that.   So as yet another move to help accelerate the safe reopening of our schools, let’s treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is.  And that means getting essential workers who provide that service — educators, school staff, childcare workers — get them vaccinated immediately.  They’re essential workers.   Over 30 states have already taken step to prior- –prioritize educators for vaccination.  And today, I’m using the full authority of the federal government.  I’m directing every state to do the same.  My challenge to all states, territories, and the District of Columbia is this: We want every educator, school staff member, childcare worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March.   To help make this happen, starting next week and for a month — the month of March, we will be using our federal pharmacy program to prioritize the vaccination of pre- And   Though we celebrate the news of the third vaccine,  We have already — we have already — and  We need the United States Senate to follow the House and pass the American Rescue Plan, because despite the optimism, without new resources, our entire effort will be set back.  We need the resources in the American Rescue Plan and we need it urgently.  We need them expanding testing, ramp up vaccine distribution, fund  We need the resources to expand genomic sequencing; to stay ahead of emerging variants; find the protective gear, transportation, staffing, and other costs required for school and business to open safely.  We need to fund it.  The bottom line is: We need the American Rescue Plan now.  Now.   There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable.  We can’t assume that.  We must remain vigilant, act fast and aggressively, and look out for one another.  That’s how we’re going to get ahead of this virus, get our economy going again, and get back to our loved ones.   So thank you.  And please, please, it’s not over yet.  Great news, but stay vigilant.  May God bless you, and may God protect our troops.  Thank you all very, very much.      When do     Yes,         No, we’ll be able to handle it, God willing.                           4:34 P.M.                    Of the 16 visits       During my visits,       Mr. President, this is what       In the Obama-Biden administration, we made a commitment that we look at Mexico as an equal, not as somebody who is south of our border.  You are equal.  And what you do in Mexico and how you succeed impacts dramatically on what the rest of the hemisphere will look like.       And as you know, the fastest-growing population in the United States is Hispanic.  And 60 percent of the Hispanic population is Mexican-American.  They’re an integral part of our history, and       And, Mr. President, I’m looking forward to our discussion today and to the many ways we’ll have to work together as neighbors and partners in meeting our shared challenges.  And thank you for doing this.                          We had a Mexican president who dominated the country for 34 years — very little time.  His name was Porfirio Díaz.  And he would say, “Poor Mexico — so far from God, and yet so close to the United States.”                    We are very thankful that you are willing to maintain good relations for the good of our peoples in North America — the Canadian, the United States, and the Mexican peoples.                                                                           Good morning, folks.  For a few weeks now, an overwhelming percentage of the American public has made it clear that they support my American Rescue Plan.  And the House of Representatives took the first step toward making it a reality.    And   And with their vote, we are one step closer to vaccinating the nation.  We are one step closer to putting $1,400 in the pockets of Americans.  We are one step closer to extending unemployment benefits for millions of Americans who are shortly going to lose them.    We’re one step closer to helping millions of Americans feed their families and keep a roof over their head.  We’re one step closer to getting our kids safely back in school.  And we’re one step closer to getting state and local governments the money they need to prevent massive layoffs for essential workers.    Now — now the bill moves to the United States Senate where   If we act now — decisively, quickly, and boldly — we can finally get ahead of this virus.  We can finally get our economy moving again.   And the people of this country have suffered far too much for too long.  We need to relieve that suffering.  The American Rescue Plan does just that: It relieves the suffering.  And it’s time to act.     11:01 A.M.         Houston, Texas  4:47 P.M.  Good afternoon — or almost.  Actually, it’s evening.  And  And Jill and  Earlier today, we received an update on the storm relief efforts from — from Harris County, at the Harris County Emergency Operations Center.  The folks there are doing God’s work, as my mother would say.  It was an important update on how the federal government and the states are working together through the major disaster declaration and the emergency declarations that  The Federal Emergency Management, FEMA, is providing millions of gallons of water and millions of meals, direct assistance, to uninsured homeowners to repair the damage burst pipes caused to millions of homes across this state.  And the public assistance that comes with a disaster declaration ensures that mayors and county officials can find shelter for folks in need and keep them safe and warm.  This in addition to the more than 125,000 blankets  FEMA, working with the Defense Logistics Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers from the Defense Department, has made generators and diesel fuel available to hospitals and nursing homes and other critical facilities to keep the lights on and speed power restoration along the way.  Many local military bases are helping efforts to distribute water and food, fuel, and blankets all across this state.   And  And  There’s more, but let me say this: We’re not here today as Democrats or Republicans.  We’re here today as Americans.  The American leaders, with responsibility — all of us here in this parking lot — responsibility to all the people we serve.  When a crisis hits our states, like the one that hit Texas, it’s not a Republican or Democrat who’s hurting; it’s our fellow Americans who are hurting.  And it’s our job to help everyone in need.  Look out for one another.  Leave nobody behind.   That’s what we’ve seen today on our visit.  After our briefing on the storm relief, we stopped by the Houston Food Bank that’s also doing God’s work — incredible operation — just like everyone else here in this — in the vaccination center.  They’ve done thousands of people.  Thousands of people.  It’s making — making a fundamental difference in the safety and security of people.  The more people get vaccinated, the faster we will beat this pandemic.  That’s why one of my first steps and my first goals as President was to announce that  And I’m proud to say we’re halfway there: 50 million shots.  Actually,  Look, in the last six weeks, we’ve gone from 6 million shots right before we took office, in total, to 12 million shots per week now.  We’ve increased vaccine distribution by 70 percent.  Sixty percent of the people over the age of six- — sixty percent of the people over the age of 75 have received at least one shot.  Close to 50 percent of the people over the age of 65 got at least one shot.  And you say, why am  Roughly 75 percent of the people who live in long-term care facilities now have gotten their first dose, and those cases are at the lowest level since reporting began in May.  We’re making this progress because of all of you.  The federal government and the states are working together along with public and private partners.   It starts with supply.  We worked with vaccine manufacturers — Pfizer and Moderna — to ensure we have enough supply to supply all adults in America by the end of July.  And we discovered that vaccine manufacturers, though, weren’t getting prioritized when it came to securing supplies they needed to fix their problem of not being able to go more rapidly.  So  Last week,  And we’ve all seen the news about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine today.  It’s just the third safe, effective vaccine.  And it’s out.  They’ve approved it today.  We’re going to use every conceivable way to expand manufacturing of the vaccine — the third vaccine — to make even more rapid progress at getting shots in people’s arms.  Here’s what else we’re doing: We’re increasing the number of vaccinators.  The people putting the — it’s one thing to have the vaccine; it’s another thing to get it in people’s arms.  We’ve brought back retired doctors and nurses by executive order, allowing that to happen.  We’ve already deployed more than 1,500 professionals — medical professionals — you see during natural disasters from FEMA, our Commissioned Corps from the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Defense Department, including the National Guard.  And we’re lining up thousands more.  We’re also setting up more places to get vaccinated.  And today — as of today, we provided $3.8 billion to states, territories, and tribes —  — to create hundreds of new vaccination centers and ramp up existing ones.  We’re providing personnel and equipment, and we’re covering the costs for states, including the use of their National Guards.   Here in Texas, it’s meant millions of dollars and hundreds of vaccinators working at community vaccination centers and three mass vaccination centers in Arlington, Dallas, and right here in Houston, on the other side here, that vaccinate thousands of Texans a day.  Tens of thousands overall.    Folks who are eligible can call by phone, sign up online for an appointment, drive in, stay in their cars, and get a shot.  In and out in a very short amount of time.  It requires massive logistical coordination and critical federal support from  Vice President Harris and  We’re working with governors across the country to stand up and lend federal support to hundreds of vaccination centers — from stadiums, like here, to community centers, to houses of worship, large parking lots, delivery places.  Doses of hope we can get in people’s arms as quickly as possible.   I’ve also sent millions of vaccines to thousands of local pharmacies — over 7,000 — to make it easier for folks to get the COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would a flu shot, because people are comfortable going to their local pharmacy.  They go there for their flu shot and everything else.  They trust the pharmacist, and they’re likely to go.  Here in Texas, that includes 500 pharmacies across this state, like Walmart and CVS, including 50 pharmacies here in Houston.  And for the folks who didn’t live near a vaccination center or a pharmacy, we’re deploying mobile clinics to go out to those neighborhoods in rural areas where people are unable to get to the centers.  These are special vehicles with pop-up clinics that meet folks where they live and where they don’t have the transportation to get the shots, which they’ll be launching very soon here in Houston — that mobile — those mobile units — as well as Dallas, Arlington, and across the state.   We’ve also started to send vaccines directly to community health centers to help the hard-to-reach folks in cities, small towns, and rural communities in black, Latino, and Native American communities that have higher rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths than any other group.   Here in Texas, we’re already partnering with 12 community health centers in 10 cities, which have combined sites at over 100 locations across the entire state.  We’re going to save people’s lives.  As a result of these round-the-clock efforts, in five weeks, America has administered the most shots of any country in the world.  That’s great progress.  And it’s also true that while COVID-19 vaccinations are up, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are down.   But  Some of our progress in this fight is because so many Americans are stepping up and doing these things.  And the worst thing we could do now would be let our guard down.   And here’s another critical point: We’re going to hit a phase in this effort, maybe late April or early May, when many predict there will be ramped-up vaccine supply and we’ll have administered shots to most of the people who really are eager to get them and those who have been able to get there.  But at the same time, the warning is: There’ll be people who live in hard-to-reach areas who can’t get the shots, and there are folks who are hesitant to take the shots.   We all know there’s a history in this country of subjugating certain communities to terrible medical and scientific abuse.  But if there’s one message that needs to cut through all of this: The vaccines are safe.   To address this challenge, we’re going to launch a massive campaign to educate people about the vaccines — that they are safe and effective, and that they can go and get those shots and be good.   I’m going to close with this: This past year has been one of the most painful years in American history.  As  And, folks, look, there’s so much we can do.  As you see the broken hearts in the families that have been left behind, there’s nothing partisan about this virus.  It’s too long we have allowed the virus to divide us.    All across the country, we’ve got members of the Armed Forces, FEMA, volunteers, retirees, fellow Americans working around the clock to give these shots.  And they’re building on the work of scientists, researchers, doctors, and nurses.  And my team at the White House, which is coordinating all of this, is first rate.   None of this has a partisan tinge or a partisan element to it.  This can be a great American achievement — being the only country in the world to reach 100 million shots in 100 days.  This could unite us as a country — to vaccinate America, to protect America, to heal America.  And   Just yesterday,  I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: If there is just one thing — one thing —  But then, last week —   We — led by a  If there’s one thing  God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  You’re the best.  We can do all of this, guys.   5:04 P.M.           Thank you very much.  Thank you, Andrew.  Let me start by saying: Guaranteed, if we’re able to, we’ll not only have you next — next year, at this time, for the governors’ conference, but we’ll have whatever food you want.  We can go around to each one of you.  We just order individually.  But all kidding aside, I’m anxious to see — Some of you have been here in the meantime, but You know, I’ve been talking to several of you quite a lot — a bit lately.  And as you know, we have approved disaster declarations in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.  In Texas, And, Governor Abbott, And it’s clear that even when the immediate crisis passes, there’s going to be more work to be done to help constituents recover.  And my administration will be there every step of the way with you because when people in this country need help, they’re not Democrats or Republicans; they’re all Americans.  And people who need work, they’re the people getting sick from COVID, and people facing eviction, people going hungry, people struggling with the opioid crisis, and people who need broadband.  They’re not Democrats or Republicans; they’re our fellow Americans.   And As governors, you know this: You know that you have one job, and that’s to deliver.  You’re on the frontlines — to overuse that phrase, but it’s hard to overuse it.  And as the saying goes, “You’re the laboratories of democracy.”  Your challenges can provide — prove to be lessons for everybody.  Your successes can prove to be a model for everybody.   The storms that hit the south were a painful reminder   that so many of our challenges don’t stop at our border of our states.  They don’t make distinctions based on how the state is made up.   Today, On Monday, our nation passed a grim, grim milestone:  COVID-19 has now taken over 500,000 of our fellow Americans.  That’s more than died in World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War combined.  And most governors, that’s more than the population of your largest cities in your state or your territories — gone.  Gone.  And as a country, we have to remember those we lost but particularly those we left behind.  But as we remember, we also have to act to end the politics of misinformation that has divided families, communities, and the country, and that has cost too many lives already.  We have to fight this together, as one, to state the obvious.   As you know, We used, as some of you have suggested, the Defense Production Act to speed up supply chains for key equipment like fill pumps and filters, which have helped increase vaccine production.   We’ve increased vaccine allocations as — as Andrew said — as the Governor said — to your states by almost 70 percent since coming into office, whatever number days ago it’s been — 37 or something like that.  We secured enough vaccine to supply 300 million Americans — 300 million — to take care of all their needs, in terms of vaccination, by the end of July.  And we’re all — and we’ve all seen in the news that Johnson & Johnson vaccine is — if the Of course, it’s not just getting the vaccines; it’s getting the vaccines in arms.  And this is another place where your work and our partnership is making a big difference.  I’ve signed an order to allow retired doctors and nurses to give shots.  We’ve deployed — as you referenced indirectly, at least, Andrew — we’ve deployed over 1,500 federal personnel as vaccinators, and we’re funding 1,200 of your Guardsmen and women to serve as vaccinators as well.  And we’re paying for your Guard for that purpose.   We’ll work with you to create more places where Americans can get vaccinated, supporting communities in high-volume vaccine centers and across your states.   The result is that we have doubled the daily vaccination rate from where it was when we took office, and we’ve completed 50 million shots in 37 days.  And we’re now — we’ve now given more shots than any nation in the entire world.  Nearly 60 percent of people over the age of 75 have now received at least one shot.  It was 14 percent six weeks ago.  Close to 50 percent — because of your help — of the people over 65 have received one shot.  It was 8 percent six weeks ago.  And this is so important because people over 65, as you know better than anyone, account for 80 percent — 80 percent of all the Additionally, about 75 percent of the people who live in long-term care facilities have gotten their first dose.  And those cases are at their lowest level since reporting began in May.   At the same time, we’re also delivering more than 25 million masks — ordered this last week — 25 million masks to over 60,000 food pantries, soup kitchens, community health centers all across America, helping protect some of our nation’s most vulnerable people.  And all — and these are all necessary steps to helping the economy rebuild.  Necessary steps, not only — but not only steps; it’s enough to build back to where we were before.  We need to build back better.  And we — We remember what happened in the states back in 2008: Hundreds of thousands of jobs disappeared every month in that Great Recession.  And we passed the Recovery Act.  We provided state and local fiscal aid.  We sent funding to your school districts to help save over 300,000 education jobs.  We provided middle-class tax relief.  We invested in the future, rebuilding roads and bridges; making the biggest clean energy investment in history and the single biggest investment in infrastructure since Eisenhower’s interstate highway program.  And we created, in the process — you all created in the process over thousands — hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs.  Now, economists tell us that saved us from a depression.  Well, that’s the approach You know, in every one of your states and territories, red and blue, millions of Americans are hurting badly.  We see it in ways that we’ve never expected in America.  Four hundred thousand small businesses gone in an instant.  Gone.  People who thought they had secure jobs out of work, due to no fault of their own.  The difference here is people are hurting through no fault of their own.  Lines miles long in your states.  People who never ever, ever, ever thought they’d ever have to worry about going hungry, waiting for someone to put a box of groceries in their trunk.   Women’s participation in the workforce — you all know this — is driven to its lowest level in more than three decades.  So many women are facing the devastating choice between a paycheck, and care and education of their child.  Our cities and towns have shed 1.3 million jobs since just last March: educators, nurses, cops, firefighters, other essential workers.   The economic toll of this pandemic continues to tear through our country as brutally as the virus itself.  And so we need to comfort [confront] the economic — you know, we just have to step up.  The economic toll we have to address with the same aggressiveness and seriousness of purpose as we do the virus.  And that’s what the American Rescue Plan does.  Instead of chasing COVID-19, it allows us to get ahead of it with more testing, supplies, vaccinations.  It gets our kids back to school safely — many of you are already doing that — so students can catch up on learning they’ve lost, and parents can finally catch a break.  The American Rescue Plan finishes the job of getting a total of two hundred thou- — or $20,000 to — direct payments to people.  Getting direct relief to people is a lifeline for them and it bumps our economy into higher gear.   And there’s more to the American Rescue Plan, and much more it will do: provide flexible aid to your cities and states to help essential workers stay in the job and essential services keep going.  It provides rent relief, food, and nutrition, and assistance to millions of children and families facing hunger.  And the American Rescue Plan also expands access to affordable childcare that’s going to enable parents, particularly mothers, to get back to work.  It provides assistance to mom-and-pop small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth and the glue of our communities.  And it covers the cost of paid leave for businesses whose workers are sickened by COVID-19.  And it fills an important gap in our nation’s safety net that helps reduce the spread of the virus.  The bottom line is: The American Rescue Plan meets the moment.  An analysis by — an analysis by Moody’s estimates that it will help the economy create 7 million more jobs this year alone.  And it would be on the way to another 18 million jobs, Moody’s estimates, would be created over the next four years with our Build Back Better recovery plan.   Look, what we do now will determine whether we build from a position of strength or whether we lose years of sluggish and unequal recovery.  And the only way to contain this pandemic and help the American people as quickly as possible is passing the plan as quickly as possible.   The vast majority the American people from both parties support it, according to the data.  I’m grateful to many of you, Democrats and Republicans, who have expressed support as well.   We are not the type of nation that can or will stand by and watch our people suffer needlessly through no fault of their own.  It goes against our conscience.  It goes against sound economics.  It’s not who we are.  We’re people who know that there’s nothing we’ve ever failed to do when we’ve set our mind to doing it.  So let’s get this done.  I’ve gotten over 400 mayors contacted me to get this plan passed.  And And may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.  We got a lot to do, guys, but we can do it.   4:52 P.M.        Eisenhower Executive Office Building   3:19 P.M. Two weeks ago, The brilliant team there made possible the rapid deployment and development of COVID-19 vaccines, and they’re truly remarkable.  And this administration will follow the science to deliver more breakthroughs.   You now, we are doing that to beat COV- — COVID-19 and other diseases, like cancer — which is something that’s so personal to so many families, including me and Kamala’s and many of yours.  We’ve asked Dr. Eric Lander, a renowned Harvard-These are the White House offices that bring together the country’s top scientists to address our most pressing needs, and they’ll be part of the work to develop a DARPA-like advanced research effort on cancer and other diseases, just like we do And relatedly, I’m delighted to see five of the nation’s leading cancer centers are joining forces today to build on the work of the Cancer Moonshot There is so much we can do, so much progress within our reach.  And that’s why I’m thankful to the folks here today for getting their vaccine shots: Gerald Bunn, who — and Corey Hamilton, both D.C. firefighters.  And the more people get vaccinated, the faster we’re going to beat this pandemic.  That’s why one of my first goals in office when At first, critics said that goal was too ambitious; no one could do that.  And then they said it was too small.  But the bottom line, though, is that America will be the first country — perhaps the only one — to get that done.   And today, I’m here to report we’re halfway there: 50 million shots in just 37 days since I’ve become President.  That’s weeks ahead of schedule, even with the setbacks we faced during the recent winter storms, which devastated millions of Midwestern — Midwestern cities, towns, and also the same in the South.   We’re moving in the right direction, though, despite the mess we inherited from the previous administration, which left us with no real plan to vaccinate all Americans.  And every time we administer another 50 million shots, I’m going to use that milestone to report to the American people on our vaccination program and on our overall fight against this pandemic.  The good and the bad, I’ll tell you; the success and the failures.   And here’s the deal — here’s the deal: The story of this vaccination campaign is like the story of everything hard and new America does: some confusion and setbacks at the start, and then if we do the right things, we have the right plan to get things moving.  That’s what we’re seeing right now.   Weeks before Other milestones: We’ve increased vaccination distribution to states by 70 percent.  Nearly 60 percent of people over the age of 75 have now received at least one shot.  It was 14 percent six weeks ago.  And close to 50 percent of people over the age of 65 have at least one shot now.  It was 8 percent six weeks ago.  It’s important because people over 65 account for 80 percent of all the Additionally, about 75 percent of the people who live in long-term facilities have gotten their first shot.  And those cases are at the lowest level since reporting began in May.  Here’s how we’ve been doing it: It starts with increasing the supply.  My team has worked very hard with vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer and Moderna, to ensure we have enough supply for all adult Americans by the end of July.  When we discovered the vaccine manufacturers weren’t being prioritized when it came to securing supplies they needed to make the vaccine, we fixed the problem.  Last week, We’ve all seen the news about Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine.  The idea of a third safe and effective vaccine is very promising.  The Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, is viewing the data and review recommendations from an outside committee of experts that will be meeting tomorrow.  Now, let me be clear: We are going to do this the right way.  The What I’ll have more to say about this in the days after the Look, we’ve been laser-focused on the greatest operational challenge this country has ever undertaken: administering shots in the arms of hundreds of millions of Americans.  We’re increasing the number of vaccinators.  What we found was, you may have the vaccine but not enough people put the vaccinate — vaccine in someone’s arm, like you just saw.   We brought back retired doctors and nurses.  We’ve already deployed more than 1,500 medical personnel you see during national disasters, from the Federal Emergency — the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA; and we commissioned — our Commissioned Corps from the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Defense Department, including the National Guard — supplying vaccinators.  We’re lining up thousands more to do the vaccinations.   We’re also setting up more places for people to get vaccinated.  As of today, we provided $3.8 billion to states, territories, and tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers and ramp up the existing ones that are there already; working with governors across the country, in red and blue states, to bolster their efforts to stand up hundreds of vaccination centers — from stadiums, to community centers, houses of worship, large parking lots.  We’re providing personnel and equipment, and covering the costs for the states, including for the use of their National Guard, which have been — they’re incredible.  Today, Jill and This is an example of the kind of partnership between federal, state, and local governments, and public and private partners, that’s going to get this job done.  We also sent millions of vaccines to thousands of local pharmacies all across America to make it easier for folks to get the vaccine shot like they would their flu shot — going to a familiar place, familiar folks that they can trust and know to get the shot.  And for folks who didn’t live near — don’t live near a vaccination center or a pharmacy, we’re deploying mobile units.  These are special vehicles and pop-up clinics that meet folks where they live and where they don’t have transportation to get the shots — to get to the places to get the shots.   We’ve also started to send vaccines directly to community health centers to help the hard — the hard-to-reach folks in cities and small towns, in rural communities; in black, Latino, Native American communities that have higher rates of As a result of these round-the-clock efforts, in five weeks, America has administered the most shots of any country in the world — any country in the world — with among the highest percentage of population fully vaccinated.  That’s progress we promised.  And it’s also true that while COVID-19 vaccinations are up, So Some of our progress in this fight is because so many Americans are stepping up and doing those things.  And the worst thing we could do now is let our guard down.  Of course, it’s my hope to come back in the next — next report that we’ve — after we’ve done another 50 million — another 50 million shots before the end of my first 100 days.  But here’s the critical point.  As hard as it is now to believe, we’re going to hit a phase in this effort, maybe as late as April or May, where many predict that instead of long lines of people waiting to get a shot, we’ll face a very different scenario: We’ll have the vaccine waiting.  We’ll have ramped up vaccine supplies.  We’ll have administrative — folks to administer the shots to the most of the people who aren’t eager to get the shots.  At least that’s been the prediction.  But, you know, at the same time, there are people who live in hard-to-reach areas who can’t get them.  And there are folks who are hesitant to take the shot in the first place.  And we all know there’s a history in this country of subjecting certain communities to terrible medical and scientific abuse.   But if there is one message that needs to cut through, it’s this: The vaccines are safe and effective.  And Listen to Dr. Fauci.  Listen to the scientists who developed these vaccines, and the extensive and rigorous review that it went through.  But the time is coming, maybe 60 to 90 days, when the supply is adequate but not enough people can access the shots or don’t want them.  To address that challenge, we’re going to launch a massive campaign to educate people about vaccines: that they are safe and effective, and where to go to get those shots in the first place.  And we’re going to bring together leaders of all segments of our society to educate and encourage all Americans to get vaccinated.   So And Now, critics say the plan is too big, that it costs too much.  But let me ask a rhetorical question: What would you have me cut?  What would you have me cut out?  On vaccines alone, if we don’t invest 20 million — billion dollars to vaccinate the nation — doesn’t that make sense?  Or $160 billion in total towards the pandemic for testing, to protective gear, to vaccine production and distribution?   I’m ready to hear any ideas on what will make the American Rescue Plan better, stronger, and effective.  But we’ll have to answer who will get helped and who will get hurt.   While things are improving, and we’re going from a mess we inherited to moving in the right direction, at significant speed, this is not a victory lap.  This — everything is not fixed.  We have a long way to go.  And that day, when everything gets back to normal, depends on all of us.  It depends on Congress passing the American Recovery Act — research plan — recovery plan.  And also for us to remain vigilant, to look out for one another.   I’ve said it before: Wash your hands.  Stay socially distanced.  Wear a mask.  Get the vaccine when it’s your turn.  When your friend or neighbor or loved one is eligible, encourage them to get vaccinated.  And when all — above all, remember: We can do this.  This is the United States of America.  There is nothing we can’t do when we do it together.  So it’s not over yet, but we’re getting close.  And God willing, if we do all we know we have to do, we’re going to beat this; beat it sooner than later.   And may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.  Thank you for your time.  3:36 P.M.         4:40 P.M.  This is a critical area where Republicans and Democrats agreed it was one of the best meetings — it’s the best meeting  There were — good, bipartisan work has already been done.  The leaders of this operation in the House and Senate already did — have done great work, and  We’re here to build on that.  And the bottom line is simple: The American people should never face shortages in the goods and services they rely on, whether that’s their car or their prescription medicines or the food at the local grocery store.  And remember, the shortages in  We heard horror stories of doctors and nurses wearing trash bags over their gown — over their dress in order to — so they wouldn’t be in trouble, because they had no gowns.  And they were rewashing and reusing their masks over and over again in the OR.  That should never have never happened.  And this will never happen again in the United States, period.  We shouldn’t have to rely on a foreign country — especially one that doesn’t share our interests or our values — in order to protect and provide our people during a national emergency.   That’s why one of the first executive orders  And today, I’m shortly going to be signing another executive order that’ll help address the vulnerabilities in our supply chains across additional critical sectors of our economy so that the American people are prepared to withstand any crisis and rely on ourselves.  This is about making sure the United States can meet every challenge we face in this new era — pandemics, but also in defense, cybersecurity, climate change, and so much more.  And the best way to do that is by protecting and sharpening America’s competitive edge by investing here at home.  As I’ve said from the beginning, while  Resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains are going to help revitalize our domestic manufacturing capacity and create good-paying jobs, not $15 an hour — which is what we need to do someday.  And sooner is better, in my view.  But jobs that are at the prevailing wage.   We’re going to spare new — spur new opportunities for small businesses, communities of color, and economically distressed areas.  And  And all this won’t just strengthen our domestic capacity, it will help unleash new markets around the world and grow opportunities for American businesses to export their goods that we’re going to be making.   These are the kinds of commonsense solutions that all Americans can get behind — workers and corporate leaders, Republicans and Democrats.  It’s about resilience, identifying possible points of vulnerabilities in our supply chains, and making sure we have the backup alternatives or workarounds in place.   Remember that old proverb: “For want of a nail, the shoe was lost.  For want of a shoe, the horse was lost.”  And it goes on and on until the kingdom was lost, all for the want of a horseshoe nail.  Even small failures at one point in the supply chain can cause outside impacts further up the chain.   Recently, we’ve seen how a shortage of computer chips — computer chips like the one  This semiconductor is smaller than a postage stamp, but it has more than 8 billion transistors — 8 billion transistors, 10,000 times thinner than a single human hair in this one chip.  These chips are a wonder of innovation and design that powers so much of our country, enables so much of our modern lives to go on — not just our cars, but our smartphones, televisions, radios, medical diagnostic equipment, and so much more.  We need to make sure these supply chains are secure and reliable.  I’m directing senior officials in my administration to work with industrial leaders to identify solutions to this semiconductor shortfall and work very hard with the House and Senate.  They’ve authorized the bill, but they need  $37 billion, short term, to make sure we have this capacity.  We’ll push for that as well.  But we all recognize that the particular problem won’t be solved immediately.   In the meantime, we’re reaching out to our allies, semiconductor companies, and others in the supply chain to ramp up production to help us resolve the bottlenecks we face now.  We need help to stop — we need to stop playing catch up after the supply-chain crisis hit.  We need to prevent the supply chain crisis from hitting in the first place.   And in some cases, building resilience will mean increasing our production of certain types of elements here at home.  In others, it’ll mean working more closely with our trusted friends and partners, nations that share our values, so that our supply chains can’t be used against us as leverage.   It will mean identifying and building surge capacity that can quickly be turned into and ramped up production in times of emergency.  And it will mean investing in research and development, like we did in the ’60s, to ensure long-term competi- — competitiveness in our manufacturing base in the decades ahead.  The order I’m about to sign does two things.  First, it orders a 100-day review of four vital products: semiconductors — one; key minerals and materials, like rare earths, that are used to make everything from harder steel to airplanes; three, pharmaceuticals and their ingredients; four, advanced batteries, like the ones used in electric vehicles.  There’s strong bipartisan support for fast reviews of these four areas because they’re essential to protecting and strengthening American competitiveness.  Second, this order initiates a long-term review of the industry basis of six sectors of our overall economy over the next year.  These reviews will identify policy recommendations to 40 of [fortify] our supply chains, to — it should be to fortify our supply chains at every step, and critically, to start implementing those recommendations right away.  We’re not going to wait for a review to be completed before we start closing the existing gaps.   And as we implement this work, my administration will draw on a full range of American talent — including labor and industry leaders, policy experts, scientists, farmers, engineers — to get their input.   I’m grateful for the members of Congress who came to see me — Republican leaders, as well as Democrats.  They’re leading the way.  We’re going to stay in close contact with members of both sides of the aisle and keep advancing our shared goals.   Everyone has a role to play to strengthen our supply chains in our — and our country.  This is the United States of America.  We are better prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century than any country in the world.  There’s nothing, nothing, nothing we’ve ever failed to achieve if we work together.  And that’s what we decided to do today, and that’s what we’re going to do: work together.   So    Thank you all very much.      As you know, previous administrations had a significant number of their — their Cabinet confirmed before they even were sworn in.  That’s the tradition.  But we’re doing fine.      Thank you.     I’m going to be talking to him.       Am     Yeah.  Yes,     Thank you.  4:50 P.M.         2:12 P.M.  The last year has shown the vulnerability we have with some of the supply chains, including the  And so we’re going to talk about that.  John Cornyn and the bipartisan group here put together an effort last year that  So thank you all for coming on in, and  2:15 P.M.         6:22 P.M. Prime Minister Trudeau and One of our last foreign trips For both our nations, getting COVID-19 under control at home and around the world is the immediate priority.  And we committed to work together to help prevent future biological threats by strengthening the World Health Organization, supporting our bold targets under the Global Health Security Agenda, cooperating on the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons [and Materials] of Mass Destruction, and engaging in — other multilateral institutions to promote transparency, build capacity, and strengthening global norms.   We also agreed to work in close cooperation to strengthen the supply chain security and resilience, and to ensure that Canada and the United States are driving a robust economic recovery that benefits everyone, not just those at the top.  That’s especially important because we know that this pandemic is not affecting everyone the same way.  Women are dropping out of work — the workforce at alarming rates.  Black, Latino, and Native are also — and other minority communities are particularly hard hit.  And we also agreed to work together on a inclusive recovery, using the tools available to us through the Small and Medium Enterprise chapter of our trade agreement to support women- and minority-owned businesses.  And we also doubled down on our efforts to tackle climate change.  It was really, really encouraging.  Now that the United States is back in the Paris Agreement, we intend to demonstrate our leadership in order to spur other countries to raise their own ambitions.  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.  To that end, we’re launching a high-level Climate Ambition Min- — Ambition Ministerial and to align our policies and our goals, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.  Prime Minister Trudeau and We both recognize our responsibility, as leading democracies, to defend our shared values around the world and to strengthen our own democracies at home.  That means rooting out systemic racism and unconscious bias from our institutions and our laws, as well as our hearts.   Today, we agreed to re-establish the Cross-Border Crime Forum and work together to modernize our approach to community safety, and to do all — the most — the most we can — do more to take on racism and discrimination in both our systems.  Canada and the United States are not only vital partners, we’re We also agreed to modernize the North American Aerospace Defense Command — And finally, coming on the heels of the G7 meeting last Friday, it was an opportunity for Tr- — Prime Minister Trudeau and Let me reiterate our support for the release of the detained Chinese — the detained in China, two Canadians: Michael Spavor and Michael Koving [sic] — Kovrig, excuse me.  Human beings are not bartering chips.  You know, we’re going to work together until we get their safe return.  Canada and the United States will stand together against the abuse of universal rights and democratic freedoms.  We’re going to strengthen our shared commitment to providing safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers, and so much more.  The United States has no closer and no more important friend than Canada.  Our nations share a close geography and history that will forever bind us together, but our values are even more consequential.  It’s — but it’s the shared spirit of our people that’s going to ensure ours is the future of hope and opportunity.  Canadians and Americans are innovative, creative, entrepreneurial, competitive, open-hearted, and rights-respecting.  There’s nothing we cannot achieve when we commit ourselves to it.  And when we work together, as the closest of friends should, we only make each other stronger.  So thank you again, Mr. Prime Minister, for your friendship and for your leadership.  And So, God bless you, and thanks for today.  Mr. President, it’s been great to sit down with you this afternoon.  This is, of course, not the first time we’ve worked together.  Back in 2016, Well, today, we’re taking our next step forward.  The President and In the face of COVID-19, of climate change, of rising inequality, this is our moment to act.  So we’re not wasting any time in getting down to work.  Job one remains keeping people safe and ending this pandemic.   This afternoon, the President and And with millions of families relying on the Canada-U.Today, the President and We’re facing tough times, there’s no doubt, but we’re not facing them alone.  Canada and the United States are each other’s closest allies, most important trading partners, and oldest friends.   And we stand united to beat this pandemic and build a better tomorrow.  And Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Joe, for your leadership, for your engagement.  And thank you in advance for all the great work we’re going to be doing together.  Merci beaucoup.   6:32 P.M.         4:16 P.M.  As you know, to state the obvious — we had a private talk about this a little while ago — the United States has no closer friend — no closer friend than Canada.  That’s why you were my first call as President, my first bilateral meeting.  And, of course, my Vice President spent some time living up in Montreal for high school.  And so our channel of communication is — are wide open.   As you know, we have a robust agenda today.  And — and we’re all best served when the United States and Canada work together and lead together in close coordination on a full range of issues we’re going to discuss: COVID-19, economic recovery, climate change, refugees and migration, fighting for our democratic values on a global stage, and — and strengthening our own democracies at home.  We spoke about this at the G7, but it’s worth saying again:  Empowering the full participation of our people, expanding opportunity and equity for everybody, ensuring the benefits of growth are shared broadly: that’s how we’re going to win the battle for the future.  So thank you again, Mr. Prime Minister, for your partnership and your enduring commitment to the U.S-China relation- — U.S.-Canadian relationship.  We’re going to talk about China.  And I’m looking forward to a very productive discussion.   The floor is yours, Mr. Prime Minister.   It’s a real pleasure to be able to — to see you today alongside Vice President Harris.  I’m glad to be joined here by our Deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland, and our Foreign Minister, Marc Garneau, whose — whose birthday it is today.  So it’s a special celebration for him.  Lots of things to talk about.  Obviously,  We’re also going to talk about climate change.  And — and thank you again for stepping up in such a big way on tackling climate change.  U.S. leadership has been sorely missed over the past — past years.  And  So we’re really excited to be working with you on — on that.  Lots — lots more to do.     I’m really looking forward to engaging with you all on — on these issues over the coming hours, but especially looking forward to getting to know your whole team as well.  Vice President Harris, it’s great — great to see you here. I’ll turn it over to you now.   And as the President said,  And as the President has said, we have a lot to do, each of us.  And together we can do a lot of it in addressing COVID; in addressing the impact of the pandemic on our countries; looking at where we have possibilities to work together, not only in terms of the public health and economic struggles of our country, but also what we have in terms of shared values around addressing the challenges of climate change.  We look forward to working — with you on that and many others.  We are neighbors.  We are friends, as a country.  And  the challenges that we face not only are, as we have said, about  So we look forward to working with you.  It is good to speak with you.  And I’ll now turn it over to Deputy Prime Minister Freeland.  And   And        Madam Vice President, we are very proud of you, and all the women and girls in Canada are very proud of you, of course.  And     4:26 P.M.        Eisenhower Executive Office Building  1:33 P.M.   We’re here today to hear directly from you, frontline workers and first responders who are doing the very vital work and have borne the weight of the COVID-19 pandemic.  You are heroes, and your service we honor.   The President’s American Rescue Plan, if passed by Congress, will bring an end to this pandemic, and it will invest in you and your fellow frontline workers and all Americans so we can keep ourselves safe and rebuild our economy so that it works for everyone.   Mr. President, joining us here today are Demetris Alfred –he goes by “Al” — who is a —    To me, he’s “Mr. President.”   Thank you all so much for being here today and for sharing your stories with us.   Mr. President, over to you.     Well, thanks for joining us, everyone.   And — and, Melanie,  MS. OWENS:  Yes.    Well, that’s pretty impressive.  That’s pretty impressive.  And, Carmen, you — you do God’s work.  You’re dealing with all those little kids and trying to figure out how you do it now and how you can safely open and how you can make it work.  MS. PALMER:    It’s a pleasure dealing with children.    Well,  And, Jeff, you have too damn many Hy-Vees around the state.     But all kidding aside, you all are — you — you’re basically holding the country together.  I’m not being facetious; I’m being deadly earnest.  You can see the looks on people’s faces when they walk into your drugstore and they stand at the counter and they ask for a prescription, can’t you?  You can see the fear in their eyes, especially if they’ve gotten a — an unwelcome analysis, like two of your family members have, Al.   And so what  And so — and every state, as you know, has a slightly different approach to how to deal with  So there’s a lot of work to do, and that’s why we want to talk to you to see whether we’re headed in the right direction.  So I’m eager to hear what’s on their mind, Susan, and see what you’re thinking — what you think we should be doing.   And now  MR. CARTER:  Right.    So, you know —  You’re the ones that keep us going.  Not a joke.  You are the ones that keep us going and kept the country going.  You’re carrying it on your back.  And so thank you for what you’ve done so far.  And we got a lot more to do.    We’d actually like to hear from each of you about your experiences during COVID.  But, Al, first I’d like to tell you — ask you to tell us about yourself.  You’re a 30-year firefighter and    Before you start, you heard — you heard that old expression: “God made man, and then he made a few firefighters.”    MR. ALFRED:  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Well, thank you.  Thank you.  And good afternoon, Ambassador Rice and Mr.  President.  It’s a pleasure to be here and an honor to be able to speak to you.  And good to see you again, Mr. President.     Good to see you.  MR. ALFRED:  We have met before, and  Let me start out by saying: In St. Louis, the firefighters have had a tough time with COVID, going on calls.  We’ve had to change up our direction on protocol a little bit, with masking up and six-feet social distancing.  We’ve even changed the protocol that when we go on medical runs and calls, people trapped in a house, and even fires — we approach them a little bit different.  We have to wear face masks.   If we just talk about medical calls, we have to wear face masks and show up.  And then we don’t send the entire crew in anymore; we’ll try to send in one guy to check out the situation, and if we can possibly get the patient to come outside, and then do the assessment and things like that.   So we’ve really had to make some changes.  We had to really look towards the government — local and state and federal — to try to keep — get our  And if you talk about the vaccine, we’ve been trying to get in line there — here in Missouri — and get as many guys vaccinated as possible so we can keep serving the community.  But make no bones about it: St. Louis firefighters are here.  We answer every call.  You know, we are resourceful and we adapt very well, and we’re ready to go.   We just would like the support from federal government, local, and state to keep us afloat so we can have the equipment and things to keep us going to do our job.  And we’ll appreciate everything you guys can do for us.    Al, let me ask you: If you had to identify the one thing — you could wave a wand — the one thing that could help your women and men and the fire- — firefighters and EMTs, what do you need the most?  MR. ALFRED:  We would like to make certain that we could get the funding down to the local level and to the fire departments in particular, so, like  But then, after things are over, once — once the crisis has passed, it appears that sometimes the local government or management — however you want to look at it — find that the department may be easy to cut because the crisis is over.  And that’s our — that’s one of our biggest concerns.   So if you ask me if    Well, that’s what we do in this legislation we put together.  And  And — and so what’s happened is a lot of states have decided that they — because they have to balance their budgets — they can’t — they can’t continue to spend the same amount of revenue they were spending before.  And what’s happening is a lot of — everything from firefighters to school teachers to a whole range of people are being laid off.  We’re short 6,000 teachers, firefighters.   And the only thing  MR. ALFRED:  Yes, sir.    Literally.  And — and so, you’re being cut.  We also find — provide for $160 billion for supplies.  And that would be everything from, you know, making sure we can scale vaccine distribution and testing, make sure everybody can get in there and have an opportunity to get the test to EMTs and firefighters.  When we get that done, we’re going to have one less crisis you have to deal with.   MR. ALFRED:  Yes, sir.     But, look, the funds we’re talking about are designed to keep teachers and school workers on the job, including — including childcare; invest in personal protective equipment.   MR. ALFRED:  Yes, sir.     And also to reduce, you know, any — just increase capacity across the board.  So, you know, we owe you a lot.   My family owes you a particularly lot.  You literally — as you know, when we talked, you saved my life.  The EMTs in my state saved my life.  Got me down to a hospital in time to save my life.  And — and my boys; you saved their lives too, with the Jaws of Life much earlier.  So we owe you big.  But what  Last thing: States set the priorities for who gets the vaccine.  We have now gone from having a shortage of vaccines to, by the end of July, we’ll have over 600 million doses of vaccine, enough to take care of everybody in the country.   And we’re moving as the — as Ms. Owens knows, we’re moving to make sure that drugstores, pharmacies are going to be able to be a place — just like for flu shots — you can go.  We’ve just gone from — because we find that that’s more accessible to an awful lot of folks who are — don’t have the means to travel very far, don’t have the access to get to where they need to go.  And they’re used to their pharmacy and they know their pharmacist, and they can get a shot.   And we’ve gone from this week — last week, 1 million doses to pharmacies to 2 million this week.  So, with the grace of God and the goodwill of neighbors, we’re going to be able to significantly increase that.  And, Carmen, I’m pushing really hard for —  So, look, Al, just — you know, don’t be shy about letting us know what you need.  And what you need in Missouri is not fundamentally different than what people need in Kansas and people need in Iowa and people need in Illinois, et cetera.  So we ought to talk some more.  Okay?   MR. ALFRED:  Absolutely, Mr. President.  And you know our famous statement: We have your back.    You have, man.  As one of your guys said, “You have my back so much, you’re breaking my shoulders,” pushing me.   MR. ALFRED:    That’s all right.    Anyway, thank you, Al.     Melanie, please give us a sense of your story.  MS. OWENS:  Hi, Mr. President.  And thank you very much, Ambassador Rice.   It is an honor and a privilege to be here with you.  And thank you for allowing me to share a small part of my story.  As she said,   It’s been a really tough year for us, but recently it’s been very rewarding to start being able to go to the long-term care facilities and vaccinate the residents there.  And also, now it’s available in the stores.  My pharmacy personally is in a low-middle class, predominantly black neighborhood, and lots of the people find it — are surprised it is very convenient and the ease of the vaccination process once they pass the scheduling portal.   So, you know,  You know, everyone had that assumption that they would have to go out far and wide to find the vaccine, but  We also — Walgreens has started a health initiatives — Health Equity program in my store, where we’re making it more convenient also to — for customers to get their prescriptions delivered to them or a reminder — personal reminding calls to let them know that their prescriptions are ready so that they aren’t forgetting about the basics.  And — but they don’t have to worry about the social distancing and, you know, coming into contact with other people if they don’t want to leave their homes or are uncomfortable.  So — but  So, President Biden, please keep rolling out the vaccine because it is helping to keep people alive and safe.  So with that,    Well, thank you, Melanie.  Look, let me — let me ask you a couple questions.  MS. OWENS:  Mm-hmm.    You’re in the South Side of Chicago; that’s where my kids’ grandparents are from.  MS. OWENS:  Awesome.    And they’re — and, you know, people are — you know, they don’t have a whole lot of money.  And a lot of people don’t — and it’s an older population these days.   MS. OWENS:  Yes.    And one of the things that I’ve observed is that there is a reluctance to — if they don’t know how to get online with you — a lot of people don’t know how to use that — they may not have a cell phone; they may not have the ability to know how to pick the phone up and get online.  They just — and — and so, they’re reluctant.   And what  So, how — how important do you think it is — what — and one more piece of this.  We also know, because of the way American medicine has taken advantage of African Americans for experimentation over the last 100 years, that there’s a real — a real reluctance that still exists in the African American community to get the vaccination, even if it’s available.  And my — I’ve been pleading with people, “Get it.”  If you have a chance, get it.  It will save not only your life potentially, but it’ll save your family a little bit.   So tell me about what you’ve sensed.   MS. OWENS:  So,  And, you know, just listening to my parents, who are in their 70s, who were so eager to get it, and  And  So,    Well, we’ve been able to increase the supply to the states, in just in the month we’ve been here, by 57 percent.  So they’re getting 57 percent more vaccine than they did before.  And we’re going to — God willing, we’re going to be in a position where we can significantly increase that as well.   So that — and the other thing is, we have set up — and we made another federal decision, saying that we were going to use community health facilities, which usually take care of the folks who are the most in need, and because they know where — I’m not being facetious when  In addition, you know, one of the things we’re going to be able to do is: Part of this investment is $20 billion in the National Vaccination Program.  As you know, the funding helps deploy community vaccinators and vaccination centers.  You’re one of them.  You’re in the community.  That’s why — but some of the governors were not sure that’s the way to go, that we — and I’m not picking on any governor.   They didn’t understand why we made the independent decision to send vaccine directly to 600-and-some — or 600 — 67 different drug chains or drugstores out there — why we send it directly to them.  And they weren’t sure why we were sending directly to childcare facilities.  That’s what we’re going to try to do now.  And so — because they thought they could better decide where to use it.  But  But  MS. OWENS:  Thank you.    Mr. President, our third participant, as you know, is Carmen Palmer.  Carmen is a childcare worker in Columbus, Ohio.  But —    That’s what   So, Carmen, we’d love to hear your story.     You obviously have a lot of spare time, Carmen.    MS. PALMER:  Of course.   Again, I’m Carmen Palmer.  You know, I’m born and raised in Detroit, Michigan.    And my role is to ensure not only zero to five children eat, but our school ages as well.   I’m a single mother, and   My — the Haynes have installed ionizers, you know, to improve our ventilation system.  And  Our enrollment is down, and we are seeing less of our families because of the pandemic.  They’re not working, and, you know, they’re losing their jobs.  And I’m just really grateful that I’m able to still work, you know, during the pandemic, and that’s important to me to keep an employment.      Well, Carmen, look, you know, we — this legislation, which we think is going to pass, is going to help childcare providers by allowing you to pay the rent; pay your utilities; your payroll, if there is one beyond you — as a loan; as well as increased costs associated with the pandemic.  And those costs include PPE; you mentioned ventilation — paying for ventilation improvement; small group sizes; modifications to make the physical environment inside safer by providing more dividers.  We’re also temporarily going to increase the Child Care Tax Credit.  Right now, if you make over a certain amount of money, you will get a tax credit of 2,000 bucks now.  We’re going to raise that to $3,000 per child, and $3,600 for a child under the age of six, and make it refundable, which is the big deal.  Because if you’re not making a lot of money and not paying taxes — you may have two or three kids — you don’t get any help at all.   But now what will happen is, if this passes, they will get a refundable credit for each child, if they’re under six — a $3,600 check from the federal government.  And — and the same thing for the $2,000, and so on.  So they say we’ll cut — if we get this done, it will cut child poverty in half.  But in addition to that, it will provide those parents with access to not only your daycare center, but others across the country to be able to afford it.   And we’re also making sure that we provide money for folks who are about to be thrown out of their homes, or, you know, there’s millions of people out there who can’t — can’t pay the rent.  And so we’ve deferred any cost to have to pay the rent while this pandemic is going on, because otherwise you just have — we’d be vastly increasing the homeless population, which makes no sense.   And so, you know, we know how — how important early childhood education and child development is.  And to get through this crisis,  And you mentioned something, Carmen, that is really important.  You know, the — most of these kids you’ve been taking care of, if they were going to kindergarten or preschool, they’d be getting a free lunch program.  Well, you know — well, we got to increase the amount of money available for what used to be called the “food stamp program,” but it’s not now.  And — but we got to make more — make it available.  Because did you ever think you’d see in your —  in your hometown where you’d see miles of cars lined up in multiple lanes, waiting for one box of food?   MS. PALMER:  No.    This is United States of America, for God’s sake.  And the idea there is that much food insecurity is — is just not right.  So what —  And what impact would it have — and last question I’ll ask — if you had to shut down?  What do you think it would do to the children and the parents that you — that now are your clients?  MS. PALMER:     Yeah.  MS. PALMER:  And even me, as myself,    Yeah.  Okay, kiddo, keep doing what you’re doing.  You’re —  MS. PALMER:  Thank you.    You’re really — as my mom would say, you’re doing God’s work, kid.   MS. PALMER:    Thank you, Mr. President.     Are you able to take them to the daycare for the hybrid school?  MS. PALMER:  Yes.  Yes,  And our, you know, teachers there are willing to, you know, help assist them, you know, with their hybrid learning.  But, you know, sometimes — you know, not even just my kids, but all the kids as well are dealing with their social and emotional needs of social distancing and really can’t go anywhere but just school and home.  So we have to, you know, deal with those aspects of the kids as well.    Well, an awful lot of children, as well as adults, are going through some real — they need some help in terms of depression and mental problem.   And, by the way, the other — a lot of you out there are struggling just to make ends meet even if you have a job, and — but we’re going to make sure you get that extra $1,400 check during the pandemic that both parties had said they support it.  Even the past President said he strongly supported it.  We just got to get it done now.  But it’ll make a difference and give you some — just, literally, some breathing room just to be able to — just — just a little breathing room.  That’s what we need to give people right now.  Because everybody in this shot, in this pro- — in this circumstance that is being hurt, it’s through no fault of their own.  It’s not their fault that the pandemic started.  Well, thank you.  MS. PALMER:  You’re welcome, Mr. President.  Thank you.   MR. CARTER:  Thank you very much, Mr. President and Ambassador Rice.   As      MR. CARTER:     We employ over 88,000 employees.  And during this past year, the pandemic has really challenged us to not only focus on service to our customers and our employees, but also serv- — safety.  You know, we really had to shift our focus rapidly on how we take care of our customers, how we make sure that they are safe when they come into stores.   We were one of the first stores to install Plexiglas shields to protect our employees and our customers.  We also put directional arrows in — on our floors to create social distancing so that, you know, people didn’t crowd and possibly spread the virus.   We also — you know,  We also — you know, we installed a system called a “Sterile Cart” that, you know, we could push our grocery carts through, in order to sanitize them and make sure that, you know, our customers were safe.  We mandated masks for our — all of our employees.  We passed out, you know, millions of masks —  Through all this, I’m very, very proud of all of the employees that, you know,  But, you know, through all this, many of our employees — you know, they put yourselves on the frontlines, and they did not shy away from doing their job and taking care of our customers and making sure the needs were met.  And  And through all that, you know, many of our employees — you know, some were a little bit, you know, concerned about going to work because they had, you know, maybe family members at home that had underlying health conditions that might put them at risk of catching the virus and possibly falling very sick or, worse, possibly death.  But they still came to work to help serve our customers and do their job.  On top of that, in Cedar Rapids, on August 10th, we had a major weather event called “derecho” that rolled through our city.    That’s amazing.  MR. CARTER:  It was an amazing event that  Many homes were damaged.  Many of our employees’ homes were damaged.  But still,  And during this derecho, we also, you know, went out into our communities and helped, you know, pass out, you know, free goods — groceries and things like that — to people in need.  Many people were without power for, you know, weeks — approximately a week that the city was without power.   So, you know, we were doing whatever we could to help the community.  So not only did we have the derecho or the  So now, as  But now, you know, I’d like to move forward, kind of, with what  And Hy-Vee is ready.  We’re ready to help you.  As Demetris said, we’ve got your back.  We just —  So we have — just recently,  But, Mr. President, we have pharmacists, we have pharmacy techs.  We have about nine mobile units ready to go out into the communities to reach people that possibly cannot get the vaccine.  We can go to them.  And we recently had an event at Drake University that, you know, we vaccinated over 1,000 people.  So  And once again, I’m very —    Well, Jeff, it’s an honor for the Ambassador and  Look, one of the things that the Ambassador and  And we spent much too much time ignoring this.  One of the things you’ve all mentioned is the  And so there’s so many things that we can do that are just within our own power.  We’re probably going to be sending out an awful lot of masks around the country, very shortly — millions of them.  But the point is that you — you all, interesting, without my asking you, talked about the need to social distance.  It’s kind of hard to social distance in a firetruck.  It’s kind of hard to social distance in a — with an      Almost 50 million right now.  And we said we’re going to do a million shots a day.   One of the things that you and Melanie know is that we had to get vaccinators.  It’s one thing to get a vaccine delivered; it’s another thing to get it out of that vial, into a needle, and into somebody’s arm.  And so we worked very hard.  We’ve probably gotten another — close to 4,000 people who give vaccinations, from National Guard, to the Defense Department, to others, and to — and to units within commercial operations that can have people who can do the vaccination.  I’ve signed an executive order allowing former retired doctors and nurses to be able to come back and give vaccinations.   And so we’re going to beat this thing because of folks like you.  And to the extent you can continue to have your constituencies — and they’re all different — is to make sure that they understand that social distancing matters, washing your hands matters, and the whole idea.  And  MR. ALFRED:  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  They’re doing pretty good.  We’re blessed.    Well, thank God.   So, but one of the things that — you know, again, I’m going to go back to the whole question of equity.  What we’re trying to do — my team and  And they’re usually — they’re used to going to the grocery store.  They’re used to going to their — to their drugstore or pharmacy.  They’re used to doing those things.  But we also are trying to get out mobile units into communities — not only inner city, but rural communities that don’t have as much access.   You know,  So, I’m glad —     — deniers, and telling all these stories about what — that aren’t true.   So,  We’re now doing a study.  The — the  And so it’s all — we’re an administration that thinks science matters.  Science matters, and it has to be available to the poorest among us and those who are most hurt by this  Do you have any questions for me?  Seriously, you can ask me anything you’d like.   MS. PALMER:  When are you coming to see us in Columbus?    Well, I’m going to be back in Columbus.   And I’m a Democrat, but  But when  MS. PALMER:   stop by the Academy.      Well, I’ll you what, I’d like —  Now, the one thing  And — and  But, look, when the American people set their minds to something, there’s nothing — nothing we’ve been unable to do if we do it together.  So with your help — and there’s so darn many — you know, we — look — look at all the stuff that’s,  And so, in the meantime, make me one promise: You all take care of yourselves.  We need you, for real.  We need you, for real, okay?     And you have the number.  You can call us anytime.      Yeah,  MR. CARTER:  We have your email,    Believe me.  She knows how to find me.      “Joe, where are you?  Come here.”     Well, we used to be “Joe.”     Still — “Joe” is still good.  All right, thank you.   PARTICIPANTS:  Thank you.     Appreciate it.  2:26 P.M.         6:01 P.M.  But as we acknowledge the scale of this mass death in America, we remember each person and the life they lived.  They’re people we knew.  They’re people we feel like we knew.  Read the obituaries and remembrances.  The son who called his mom every night just to check in.  The father’s daughter who lit up his world.  The best friend who was always there.  The nurse — the nurse and nurses — but the nurse who made her patients want to live.   We all know someone — fellow Americans who lived lives of struggle, of purpose, and of hope.  Who talked late into the night about their dreams; who wore the uniform, born to serve; who loved, prayed, and always offered a hand.   We often hear people described as “ordinary Americans.”  There’s no such thing; there’s nothing ordinary about them.  The people we lost were extraordinary.  They spanned generations.  Born in America.  Immigrated to America.  But just like that, so many of them took final breath alone in America.  As a nation, we can’t accept such a cruel fate.  While we have been fighting this pandemic for so long, we have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow.  We have to resist viewing each life as a sta- — as a statistic or a blur or on the news.  And we must do so to honor the dead, but equally important, care for the living and those left behind.  For the loved ones left behind,  For some of you, it’s been a year, a month, a week, a day, even an hour.  And   Well, that’s what has been so cruel.  So many of the rituals that help us cope, that help us honor those we loved, haven’t been available to us.  The final rites with family gathered around.  The proper homegoing, showered with stories and love.  Tribal leaders passing [with]out the final traditions of sacred cultures on sacred lands.  As a nation, we cannot and we must not let this go on.  That’s why the day before my inauguration, at the COVID-19 Memorial at the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall,  For those who have lost loved ones, this is what  And for me, the way through sorrow and grief is to find purpose.   So today,  But as we remember — as we all remember,  We have to fight this together, as one people, as the United States of America.  That’s the only way we’re going to beat this virus,  For in this year of profound loss, we have seen profound courage from all of you on the frontlines.   In just a few minutes, Jill and I, Kamala and Doug, will hold a moment of silence here in the White House — the People’s House, your house.  We ask you to join us to remember, so we can heal; to find purpose in the work ahead; to show that there is light in the darkness.   This nation will smile again.  This nation will know sunny days again.  This nation will know joy again.  And as we do, we will remember each person we’ve lost, the lives they lived, the loved ones they left behind.  We will get through this,  May God bless you all, particularly those who have lost someone.  God bless you.  6:11 P.M.         Eisenhower Executive Office Building  12:29 P.M.  Small businesses are the engines of our economic progress; they’re the glue and the heart and soul of our communities.  But they’re getting crushed.  Since the beginning of this pandemic, 400,000 small businesses have closed — 400,000 — and millions more are hanging by a thread.  It’s hurting black, Latino, and Asian American communities the hardest.  Walk down any Main Street and you see it: empty storefronts, goodbye signs hanging in the windows.  Maybe it’s the pizza place you used to take your family to dinner, or the hardware store that always had the tool you needed.  It’s mom-and-pop shop that’s sponsored by — that is supported by the community, and then, in turn, they support the community.  They sponsor a Little League team; the barber shop with the first dollar bill that he or she earned is still taped to the wall, along with a picture of the kids who are now in college.   These small businesses — not the ones with 500 employees, but these small businesses that, with a handful of folks, they are 90 percent of the businesses in America.  But when the Paycheck Protection Program was passed, a lot of these mom-and-pop business just got muscled out of the way by bigger companies who jumped in front of the line.  And  In the last month, we’ve increased the share of funding for small businesses with fewer than 10 employees by nearly 60 percent.  For businesses in rural communities, the share of funding is up nearly 30 percent since we came to office.  And the share of funding distributed through banks that traditionally help minority-owned businesses is up more than 40 percent.   And today, I’m announcing additional changes to the  The Small Business Administration will also remove barriers that have stopped many businesses from being able to apply for these loans.  For example, we’re making it so that a student loan default or a non-fraud-related criminal record does not prohibit someone from applying for the program.  We’re also making it easy for those one-person businesses — like the home repair contractors; beauticians; small, independent retailers — to secure forgivable  At the same time, we’re increasing access by increasing oversight.   We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan.  It deals with the immediate crisis facing our small businesses.   Now, critics say the plan is too big.  Let me ask them a rhetorical question: What would you have me cut?  What would you leave out?  The American Rescue Plan targets $50 billion to support the hardest-hit small businesses after this program expires at the end of March.  Would you not help invest in them?  Would you let them continue to go under?  Would you leave them out again, like the previous administration did?   One of the things I’ve heard again and again from small-business owners like Pilar and Tim is that knowing about support is one thing; being — gaining access to getting it is another.  That’s why we proposed $175 million to bring community organizations in to serve as “navigators” who’ll help them through this process of application.  We would also establish a hotline, with help available in multiple languages, so folks can pick up a phone and get the help they need to stay open and serve their community.  Again, the critics: “It’s too big.”  Should we not — should we stop spending money on them?  Do we not want a return on investment that we make in these businesses to be able to stay open and thrive and pay back?  Why would we not want to make sure a small business, who lack teams of lawyers, bankers, and accountants, have an advocate — someone they can rely on — to direct them to help that’s there for them now — will be there for them?  The American Rescue Plan is a rescue plan for America’s small businesses and America’s mainstream businesses.  And we need Congress to pass it right away.  I’m grateful to the Senate and the House for moving so quickly.  And   And it’s my hope — my hope that as Democrats and Republicans, who have backed the  Major economists — left, right, and center — here and abroad say we should focus on smart investments that can make jobs available and focus on the jobs and in the people to prevent lo- — prevent long-term economic damage to our nation and to strengthen the economic competitiveness going forward.   In fact, an analysis by Wall Street’s firm, Moody’s, estimates that if we pass my American Rescue Plan, the economy will create 7 million jobs this year.  This year.  We’ve also been in constant contact with the mayors and governors, county officials, members of Congress of both parties in every state.  That includes a letter,  Getting our economy back means bringing our small businesses back.  And that’s what we’re going to do.  That’s what I’m doing today.  We’re going to focus.  The program ends at the end of March, but for the next two weeks, the only folks who can apply for that  Thank you very much.  12:38 P.M.        Kalamazoo, Michigan   3:24 P.M.   They’ll be part of the administration’s work to develop a DARPA-like advanced research effort on cancer and other diseases, just like there is  This administration is going to be guided by science — to save lives and to make lives better.  And that’s why  And Michigan is also fortunate to have my buddy Gary Peters as United States senator, and Debbie Stabenow.  Gary is here.  Gary has been a workhorse in making sure that we move through this funding to get things done, because he understands better than anyone: It’s about urgency — the urgency of the moment.  So, Gary — thank you, Senator.  Thank you for all you’re doing.  Last week,  And now it’s a second miracle — a miracle of manufacturing — to produce hundreds of millions of doses. Let me say that again: hundreds of millions of doses.   And let me say parenthetically that it’s not enough that we find cures for Americans.  There needs to be cures that the world is able to take part of, because you can’t build a wall or a fence high enough to keep a pandemic out.  On our tour,  All of this is followed by extensive safety and quality control inspection, then careful packaging and labeling.  We walked by a freezer farm that then keeps those doses viable so they can be shipped.  This is an incredibly complex process.  And at every stop, safety is the utmost priority.  The whole process takes teamwork, precision, and around-the-clock focus. Machinists operating some of the most advanced equipment in the world, working side by side with chemists, biologists, pioneering technologies that, less than a year ago, were little more than theories and aspirations.  And it takes a partnership, in our view, between the federal government and all of the companies and universities contributing to the vaccine effort.   Just over four weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country.  My predecessor — as my mother would say, “God love him” — failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers.  That changed the moment we took office.     Here’s what else we did: When we discovered that vaccine manufacturers weren’t being prioritized when it came to scrutinizing and securing supplies they needed, we fixed that problem and got them what they needed.  We also used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for que- — for key equipment, like fill pumps and filters, which has already helped increase vaccine production.    In fact, on our tier [sic] — on our tour today, they showed me a critical piece of machinery they didn’t have before; now, they do.  And it’s allowing them to ramp up production.    And as we increase supply, we’re carrying out a clear plan to get shots into the arms of 300 million Americans or more.  And  And listen to Dr. Fauci.  Dr. Fauci assured me the COVID-9 [sic] vact- — vaccines were safe.  That’s why, several weeks ago,  We all know there is some history — there’s some hesitancy about taking this vaccine.  We all know there’s a history in this country of having subjected certain communities to terrible medical abuses in the past.  But if there’s one message to cut through to everyone in this country, it’s this: The vaccines are safe.  Please, for yourself, your family, your community, this country, take the vaccine when it’s your turn and available.  That’s how to beat this pandemic.    And we’re making progress.  We deployed more vaccinators, the people who put the vaccine in your arm. We’re now making it possible for retired doctors and nurses to come back and, under the law, administer these shots.  We’ve put new vaccinators in the field.  These include over 800 medical personnel from our Commissioned Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services, and personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Agency —  We’re also creating more places for people to get vaccinated.  We’ve provided $3 billion to states, territories, and tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers to ramp — and ramp up the existing ones that now — that are there.    Right here in Michigan, with Governor Whitmer,  We’ve worked with governors in California, Texas, New York, and more to come, to stand up massive — mass vaccine sites in stadiums that will be open 24/7, and arenas and community centers.  It’s an effort that’s on top of the federal government covering the full cost for the states’ use of their National Guards for pandemic efforts.  And you suggested  We also started shipping vaccines directly to thousands of local pharmacies across the country so eligible folks can get the COVID-19 shot like they would a flu shot.    Here in Michigan, that’s already more than 220 pharmacies, like Rite Aid and Meijers, in more than 130 Michigan cities.  And that’s just the beginning.  It’s only been four weeks.   And for folks who aren’t near a pharmacy or a mass vaccination center, we’re deploying mobile clinics. These are special vehicles and pop-up clinics that meet folks where they live — folks who don’t have access to transportation to get the shots.    We’re also supplying vaccines to community health centers — federal community health centers — to reach those who are hit the hardest: black, Latinos, Native Americans, and rural communities, which have higher rates of  Here in Michigan, we’re already partnering with community health centers, serving more than 370,000 patients in 11 cities across the state.  That’s because you guys have pointed out where they were and why it was so important, and how we get to — as Gary talks about, get to the people most in need and the people most dying from COVID.  This is important to ensure everyone is treated equally and those hardest hit get the care they deserve.     We’re now at a point where we’ve seen the average daily number of people vaccinated nearly double, from the week before  You may remember when  But despite the progress, we’re still in the teeth of a pandemic.  New strains are emerging.  In a few days, we’ll cross 500,000 Americans who will have died from COVID-19.  Five hundred thousand.  That is almost 70,000 more than all the Americans who died in World War Two, over a four-year period. All the sorrow, all the heartache, all the pain.      And while we wait for everyone to get vaccinated, we still need you to wash your hands, stay socially distanced, and mask up to help save lives.  That’s why, with the authority  Look, We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan that deals with the immediate crisis — the urgency. Now, critics say my plan is too big, that it costs $1.9 trillion.  So that’s too much.  Well, let me ask them: What would they have me cut?  What would they have me leave out?  Should we not invest $20 billion to vaccinate the nation?  Should we not invest $290 million [billion] to extend unemployment insurance for the 11 million Americans who are unemployed so they can get by while they get back to work?  Should we not invest $50 billion to help small businesses stay open, when tens of thousands have had to close permanently?  Should we not invest — and, by the way, they make up half the employment in America. Should we not invest $130 million [billion] to help schools across the nation open safely?    Right now, 24 million adults, 11 million children don’t have enough food to eat. And unless you think I’m exaggerating, think of those scenes you’ve seen on the television with cars lined up, which seemed like miles, to wait to have someone put a box of food in their trunk.  People never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever thought they would need help, and through no fault of their own, they’re in that circumstance.  If we don’t pass the American Rescue Plan, 40 million Americans will lose [some of their] nutritional assistance through a program we call SNAP, the old food stamp program.  Do we not invest $3 million — $3 billion to keep families from going hungry?   One in five Americans are behind in their rent.  One in ten are being in their mortgages.  How many people do you know that will go to bed tonight staring at the ceiling, saying, “God, what is going to happen if  This is the United States of America, for God’s sake.  We invest in people who are in need.  Do we not invest $35 billion to help people keep a roof over their heads?   But we have to make clear who is helped and who is hurt.  And my hope is that the Republicans in Congress listen to their constituents.    According to the polls, there is overwhelming bipartisan support.  The vast majority of the American people — more than 70 percent of the American people, with all the polls you all conduct, including a majority of Republicans — want us to act, and act big and quickly and support the plan.  Major economists — left, right, and center — say we should focus on smart investments we can make now in jobs, in our people to prevent long-term economic damage to our nation and to strengthen the economic competitiveness going forward.  In fact, an analysis by the Wall Street firm Moody’s estimates that if we pass my American Rescue Plan, the economy will create 7 million jobs this year. This year.    We’ve also been in constant contact with mayors and governors, county officials, members of Congress — both parties.  Both parties.  I’ve met with them in my office; I’ve met with them in — on the — on the Internet — on — Zooming on with them.  Both parties in every state.  And guess what?  They agree we have to act now.     That’s why the American Rescue Plan puts 160 million — billion dollars into more testing and tracing, manufacturing and distribution, and setting up vaccination sites — everything that’s needed to get vaccines into people’s arms, which is the most difficult logistical effort the United States has undertaken in peace time.  It includes $4 billion for new manufacturing plants so we’re ready to manufacture vaccines in the future.  We don’t have to wait.    I’m going to close with what   And all of you here are doing some of the most important work in this facility, right here, that can be done.  And  How many of you know somebody who’s in real trouble or has passed?  How many people do you know who sat down to breakfast this morning and looked at an empty chair across the table?  You’ve seen the devastation of this virus in your family, your community, but you’re stepping up.  You’re saving lives here — lives of your loved ones, your neighbors, your fellow Americans.  You’re showing how this town, this state, this country takes care of our own, leaves nobody behind.    We can do anything when we do it together.   May God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  And, Albert, thank you and your people for all you do.  MR. BOURLA:  Thank you, Mr. President.    Thank you.                  Well, all we got to do is do a little bit of the math. Getting the vaccine and having it available is not the same as putting it in someone’s arms.  This is going to be a continuous rolling effort.  So we’ll have had — we will have ordered, much of which will have been distributed, over 600 million doses by the end of July.  July 29th is the expected date.  That could change.  Look at what’s happening with the weather now, for example: It’s slowing up the distribution right now.  But  But  We’re going to have debates about whether or not — for example,  You were at that town meeting  There’s a difference, for example, according to the science now, between kids between the ages of 3 and probably 12 years old, in terms of whether they can absorb and/or communicate the disease than it is for kids who are 15, 16, 17, and 18 years old who congregate more together.  It’s harder in a high school than it is in a grammar school.  We know certain things are necessary: social distancing, smaller class sizes, ventilation, testing, and the possibility that staff, whether it’s the staff taking care of the sanitary conditions in the school, or simply — you’ve heard me say this before — bus drivers.  To open the schools, we need more buses and bus drivers.  We can’t put kids packed in a bus, sitting next to one another.   So we know the things that have to be done.  The question is the order in which we do them is going to — determined on what moves the quickest and where the need is the greatest. Obviously, we still have to focus on first responders, our doctors, our nurses, those delivering the services.   But the reason  We also know that it’s one thing to have a vaccine available.  The problem was, how do you get it into people’s arms?  There’s not enough people to vaccinate. All the great hospitals in this state, and in my state, they can line up and give people, but they can’t possibly handle the volume that is needed.  So what do you do?  You get more people qualified to give vaccinations.  The quicker you can open up places and that people can come up and demonstrate they’re on — on the pecking order and they’re ready for their shot, and they’re qualified — keeping places open 24/7 makes a lot of sense, but you need people to do it.   So we all know the basic things that have to happen.  Now, we also know that there are things that intervene.  Things happen.  Weather.  People get ill. People get confused.  There’s a lot of people who don’t — aren’t able.    You know,  Talk about — everybody is — you know, most people are within five miles of a pharmacy.  Well, if you’re living alone and you’re a 68-year-old woman, and you’re in a minority neighborhood, and there’s no bus service, you might as well be 500 miles away.  That’s why we’re leading now — and, Gary, you talked to me about it — getting mobile vans to go out.    So we know the kinds of things that have to be done.  But there has never ever, ever been a logistical challenge as consequence — as consequential as we’re trying to do.  But we’re getting it done.    And as my mom would say, with the grace of God and the goodwill of neighbors, we’re going to save a lot of lives.    Thank you very much.    3:50 P.M.         11:17 A.M.  For decades, as you pointed out, I’ve participated in the Munich Security Conference — as a U.S. senator, joining my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to affirm the importance of the transatlantic partnership; three times as the Vice President of the United States, including delivering the first international foreign policy address of the Obama-Biden administration in the first months we were in office.   And two years ago, as you pointed out, when   It comes down to this: The transatlantic alliance is a strong foundation — the strong foundation — on which our collective security and our shared prosperity are built.  The partnership between Europe and the United States, in my view, is and must remain the cornerstone of all that we hope to accomplish in the 21st century, just as we did in the 20th century.  The challenges we face today are different.  We’re at an inflection point.  When  So let me erase any lingering doubt: The United States will work closely with our European Union partners and the capitals across the continent — from Rome to Riga — to meet the range of shared challenges we face.   We continue to support the goal of a Europe whole and free and at peace.  The United States is fully committed to our  You know, to me and to the United States, and to us, we’ll keep article — we’ll keep faith with Article 5.  It’s a guarantee.  An attack on one is an attack on all.  That is our unshakable vow.  And the only time Article 5 has been invoked was after the United States was attacked on 9/11.  You, our allies, joined us to fight al Qaeda, and the United States committed to consulting closely with our  My administration strongly supports the diplomatic proc- — process that’s underway and to bring an end to this war that is closing out 20 years.  We remain committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again provides a base for terrorist attacks against the United States and our partners and our interests.   Our European partners have also stood with us to counter ISIS.  Just this week,  And while the United States is undergoing a thorough review of our own force posture around the world, I’ve ordered the halting of withdrawal of American troops from Germany.  I’m also lifting the cap imposed by the previous administration on the number of U.S. forces able to be based in Germany.    Earlier today, as was referenced,  Achieving these goals is going to depend on a core strategic proposition, and that is: The United States must renew America’s enduring advantages so that we can meet today’s challenges from a position of strength.  That means building back better our economic foundations; reclaiming our place in international institutions; lifting up our values at home, and speaking out to defend them around the world; modernizing our military capabilities while leading with diplomacy; revitalizing America’s network of alliances and partnerships that have made the world safer for all people.   You know,  None of this has fully succeeded in this — none of us has fully succeeded in this division [vision].  We continue to work toward it.  And in so many places, including in Europe and the United States, democratic progress is under assault.    Historians are going to examine and write about this moment as an inflection point, as  Democracy doesn’t happen by accident.  We have to defend it, fight for it, strengthen it, renew it.  We have to prove that our model isn’t a relic of our history; it’s the single best way to revitalize the promise of our future.  And if we work together with our democratic partners, with strength and confidence,  You know, we must prepare together for a long-term strategic competition with China.  How the United States, Europe, and Asia work together to secure the peace and defend our shared values and advance our prosperity across the Pacific will be among the most consequential efforts we undertake.  Competition with China is going to be stiff.  That’s what  We can own the race for the future.  But to do so, we have to be clear-eyed about the historic investments and partnerships that this will require.  We have to protect — we have to protect for space for innovation, for intellectual property, and the creative genius that thrives with the free exchange of ideas in open, democratic societies.  We have to ensure that the benefits of growth are shared broadly and equitably, not just by a few.   We have to push back against the Chinese government’s economic abuses and coercion that undercut the foundations of the international economic system.  Everyone — everyone — must play by the same rules.   U.S. and European companies are required to publicly disclose corporate governance — to corporate governance structures and abide by rules to deter corruption and monopolistic practices.  Chinese companies should be held to the same standard.   We must shape the rules that will govern the advance of technology and the norms of behavior in cyberspace, artificial intelligence, biotechnology so that they are used to lift people up, not used to pin them down.  We must stand up for the democratic values that make it possible for us to accomplish any of this, pushing back against those who would monopolize and normalize repression.   You know, this is also — this is also how we’re going to be able to meet the threat from Russia.  The Kremlin attacks our democracies and weaponizes corruption to try to undermine our system of governance.  Russian leaders want people to think that our system is more corrupt or as corrupt as theirs.  But the world knows that isn’t true, including Russians — Russia’s own citizens.   Putin seeks to weaken European — the European project and our  That’s why — that’s why standing up for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine remains a vital concern for Europe and the United States.  That’s why addressing recklessness — Russian recklessness and hacking into computer networks, in the United States and across Europe and the world, has become critical to protecting our collective security.  The challenges with Russia may be different than the ones with China, but they’re just as real.   And it’s not about pitting East against West.  It’s not about we want a conflict.  We want a future where all nations are able to freely determine their own path without a threat of violence or coercion.  We cannot and must not return to the reflective [reflexive] opposition and rigid blocs of the Cold War.  Competition must not lock out cooperation on issues that affect us all.  For example, we must cooperate if we’re going to defeat COVID-19 everywhere.   My first presidential national security memorandum focused on surging health and humanitarian responses to defeat COVID-19 and to better prevent and prepare for the next pandemic.   Today, I’m announcing that the United States is making a $2 billion pledge to COVAX, with the promise of an additional $2 billion to urge others to step up as well.    Yet, even as we fight to get out of the teeth of this pandemic, the resurgence of Ebola in Africa is a stark reminder that we must simultaneously work to finally finance health security; strengthen global health systems; and create early warning systems to prevent, detect, and respond to future biological threats, because they will keep coming.  We have to work together to strengthen and reform the World Health Organization.  We need a U.N. system focused on biological threats that can move quickly to trigger action.  Similarly, we can no longer delay or do the bare minimum to address climate change.  This is a global, existential crisis, and we’ll all suffer — we’ll all suffer the consequences if we fail.   We have to rapidly accelerate our commitments to aggressively curb our emissions and to hold one another accountable for meeting our goals and increasing our ambitions.    That’s why, as President,  On Earth Day,   The threat of nuclear proliferation also continues to require careful diplomacy and cooperation among us.  We need transparency and communication to minimize the risk of strategic misunderstanding or mistakes.  That’s why the United States and Russia, notwithstanding other competition, extended the New  That’s why we have said we’re prepared to reengage in negotiations with the P5+1 on Iran’s nuclear program.  We must also address Iran’s destabilizing activities across the Middle East, and we’re going to work in close cooperation with our European and other partners as we proceed.   We’ll also work together to lock down fissile and radiological material to prevent terrorist groups from acquiring or using them.   Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex.  And I’m eager to hear — I’m eager to hear — I’m eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward together.   So let me conclude with this: We cannot allow self-doubt to hinder our ability to engage each other or the larger world.  The last four years have been hard.  But Europe and the United States have to lead with confidence once more, with faith in our capacities, a commitment to our own renewal, with trust in one another and the ability of Europe and the United States to meet any challenge to secure our futures together.   Over the next few years — “Percy” is  call — but Perseverance will range and collect samples from the Red Planet and pile them up so another mission and rover, envisioned as a joint effort between  That’s what we can do together.  If our unbound capacity to carry us to Mars and back don’t tell us anything else, they tell us we can meet any challenge we can face on Earth.  We have everything we need.  And  America is back.  So let’s get together and demonstrate to our great, great grandchildren, when they read about us, that democracy — democracy — democracy functions and works, and together, there is nothing we can’t do.  So let’s get working.  Thank you all very much.  Thank you, folks.     Yes,   And as a little bit along the lines  And so thank you all so very much.     Say again.     It depends.  The answer is yes.  The question is,  Okay?  Thank you.  11:38 A.M.         4:06 P.M.  Every once in a while, as President, you get to invite close friends into the Oval.     This is American labor.  And   And as  So what we’re doing here today, we’re —  We are so far behind the curve.  We rank something like 38th in the world in terms of our infrastructure — everything from canals to highways to airports to — everything we can do, and we need to do, to make ourselves competitive in the 21st century.   And so the Vice President and  So, anyway, I’ll let you know.  We’re going to have a long conversation here.   So, thank you all for coming in.      And the truth of the matter is, the polling data from last night, and all the polls you’ve all done — they come from you guys; not you personally, but your networks and your organizations — show that somewhere between 64 and 69 percent of the American people think we have to do this.  And it’s not about the money; it’s about in order to do everything from open schools, as we should, to make sure that we’re generating income for people who are in real trouble.  It’s about how much it costs.  The federal government has to chip in, make sure we get this done.   And as  And that’s what we’re talking about here.  We’re going to talk about how we grow the economy.  So thank you all for coming in.  Appreciate it.  Appreciate it.  Thank you very much.               Milwaukee, Wisconsin    7:59 P.M.  Tonight, we’re going to be answering questions from the American people.  The President will be answering questions from the American people on his first official trip since taking office.  Some of the questioners here voted for him.  Some did not.   The President and  With that,    Hey, Anderson.  MR. COOPER:  How are you, sir?    Good to see you, man.  Hey, folks.  How are you?    Good to be back, man.  MR. COOPER:  Yeah, it’s nice to see you, sir.    And you know you enjoy being home with the baby more.   MR. COOPER:        MR. COOPER:     That’s right.  MR. COOPER:  Yeah.  So we got a lot of questions in the audience.  We have about 50 or so people here.  They’re all socially distanced.  We have some folks who voted for you, some folks who did not.  And we’re going to get as many questions in as possible.  Before we get to that,    Sure.  MR. COOPER:  New cases of COVID-19 hospitalizations have fallen by half in the last month, so have new cases.  That’s the good news.  There’s this potential threat — potential surge from the variants coming down the pike potentially.  When is every American who wants it going to be able to get a vaccine?    By the end of July of this year.  We have — we came into office, there was only 50 million doses that were available.  We have now — by the end of July, we’ll have over 600 million doses — enough to vaccinate every single American.  MR. COOPER:  When you say —  — when you say “by the end of July,” do you mean that they will be available or that people will have been able to actually get them?  Because Dr. Fauci —    They’ll be available.  MR. COOPER:  They’ll be available.    They’ll be available.  MR. COOPER:  Okay.    Here, look, we — what we did — we got into office and found out the supply — there was no backlog.   We’ve upped that, in the first three weeks that we were in office, to significantly more than that.  We’ve moved out — went to the Pfizer and Moderna, and said, “Can you produce more vaccine and more rapidly?”  They not only agreed to go from 200 to 400 — and they’ve agreed to go to 600 million doses.  And that’s — and they’re — and we got them to move up the time because we used the National Defense Act to be able to help the manufacturing piece of it to get more equipment and so on.  MR. COOPER:  So if, end of April — excuse me, end of July, they’re available to actually get them in the arms of people who want them, that will take — what? — a couple more months?    Well, no, a lot will be being vaccinated in the meantime.  MR. COOPER:  Okay.    In other words, it’s not all of a sudden 600 million doses are going to appear.  And what’s going to happen is: It’s going to continue to increase as we move along, and we’ll have — we’ll have reached 400 million by the end of May and 600 million by the middle of — by the end of July.  And the biggest thing, though, as you remember when you and  MR. COOPER:  That’s been one of the problems is just getting enough people.    Yes, now we have — we have made significant strides increasing the number of vaccinators.  I’ve —  So we have significant number of vaccinators — people who would actually be there.  Plus, we’ve opened up a considerable number of locations where you can get the vaccination.  MR. COOPER:   Kevin, welcome.  What’s your question?     How you doing?     Yes.      My mother would say, “God bless you, son.”  No purgatory for you — four kids home.   And so, what we found out is, there are certain things that make it rational and easy to go back to the brick-and-mortar building.  One, first of all, making sure everybody is wearing protective gear — it’s available to students, as well as to teachers, the janitors, the people who work in the cafeteria, the bus drivers.  Secondly, organizing in smaller pods, which means that’s why we need more teachers.  Instead of a classroom of 30 kids in it, you have three classes and that same — of 10 kids each in those.  And I’m — I’m not making the number up; it might be less.  It doesn’t have to be literally 10.   In addition to that, we also have indicated that it is much better, it’s much easier to send kids K-through-8 back because they are less likely to communicate the disease to somebody else.  But because kids in — sophomores, juniors, and seniors in high school — they socialize a lot more, and they’re older, and they transmit more than young kids do, it’s harder to get those schools open without having everything from the ventilation systems and — and having —  For example, school bus drivers — you know, we — we got to make sure that you don’t have 60 kids, or however many there — depending on the size of school bus — sitting two abreast in every single seat.  And so there’s a lot of things we can do, short of — and  MR. COOPER:  Well, let me ask you, you — your administration had set a goal to open the majority of schools in your first 100 days.  You’re now saying that means those schools may only be open for at least one day a week.    No, that’s not true.  That’s what was reported; that’s not true.  There was a mistake in the communication.  But what  MR. COOPER:  So when do you think that would be — K-through-8, at least five days a week if possible?     MR. COOPER:  Do you think that would be five days a week or just a couple?     MR. COOPER:     What do you teach?     My wife teaches.  God love you.     Number one, nobody is suggesting, including the  So it’s about needing to be able to socially distance, smaller classes, more protection.  And  MR. COOPER:   Kerri, welcome.  Go ahead.     Kerri, how are you?   We’ve tried all we can to get him a vaccine.     Well, the answer is: Yes, there are.   But here’s how it works: The states make the decision on who is — or in what order.   But here’s what I’d like to do: If you’re willing, I’ll stay around after this is over, and maybe we can talk a few minutes and see if  MR. COOPER:  Let — let me just ask you, though: Johnson & Johnson could be authorized — a new vaccine from them could be authorized in a couple of weeks.  That would be a big deal —    Yes, it would.  MR. COOPER:  — bringing a lot more vaccines on, millions of more doses to the supply.  Once that happens, given the urgency of these variants, and the potential threat from them, should states stop giving priority to certain groups and just open vaccine access for everyone?    Well, it depends on how much they have available.   And, look, we don’t know for certain.  Let me tell you what my national  MR. COOPER:  London.  Yeah.    — and London, et cetera.  There’s thus far — thus far, there is no evidence that the existing vaccinations available for Moderna and Pfizer do not either make sure that they apply — they work as well against the strain in the United States.  And there is no evidence that they’re not helpful.   So if you can get a vaccination, get it whenever you can get it, regardless of the other strains that are out there. There are studies going on to determine it is not only more communicable, but are there vaccine — do the vaccines not provide helpful protection by getting the vaccine.  There are some speculation.   MR. COOPER:  It may not be as effective as —    It may not be as effective.  MR. COOPER:  — against a variant, but it still would be effective.    It’d still be effective.  So the clear notion is: If you’re eligible, if it’s available, get the vaccine.  Get the vaccine.  MR. COOPER:   Dessie, welcome.    By the way — you’ve heard me say this before, Becky [sic] — if there’s any angels in heaven, they’re all nurses, male and female.  Doctors let you live, nurses make you want to live.      Well, first of all, it is a priority, number one.   Number two, there’s two reasons for it being the way it is.  Number one, there is some history of blacks being used as guinea pigs and other experiments —  But the biggest part of it is access — physical access.  That’s why, last week,  Secondly, we have opened up — and I’m making sure that there’s doses of vaccine for over 6,700 pharmacies, because almost everyone lives within not always walking distance, but within the distance of being able to go to the pharmacy, like when you got your flu shot.  That is also now being opened.  Thirdly,  The other thing we found is — and I’m sorry to go on, but this is really important to me.  The other part — portion is, a lot of people don’t know how to register.  Not everybody in the community — in the Hispanic and the African American community, particularly in rural areas that are distant and/or inner-city districts — know how to use — know how to get online to determine how to get in line for that  So we’re also — I’ve committed to spend a billion dollars on public education to help people figure out how they can get in there.  That’s why we’re also trying to set up mass vaccination centers, like places in stadiums and the like.  MR. COOPER:  Are you concerned about the rollout of this online?  Because it has been incredibly confusing for a lot of people, not just —    Sure.  MR. COOPER:  — you know, older people.  It’s younger people just trying to find a place to get a vaccine.    Yes.  And  Number two, there was very little federal guidance; it’s to say, what to look for, how to find out where, in fact, you could go.  You can go online, and every single state now has a slightly different mechanism by which they say who’s qualified, where you can get the vaccines, and so on.   So it’s all about trying to more rationalize in detail so ordinary people, like me, can understand.   But all kidding aside, so this is a process, and it’s going to take time.  It took us a — think of what we didn’t do.  And you and  We wasted so much time.  So much time.  MR. COOPER:  Another question about vaccines.  This is Jessica Salas.  She’s an independent from the Milwaukee, a graphic designer.   Jessica, welcome.     Well first of all, honey — what’s your first name?     Layla.  Beautiful name.  First of all, kids don’t get the vacci- — get  Number two, we haven’t even done tests yet on children as to whether or not the certain vaccines would work or not work, or what is needed.  So that’s — so you — you’re the safest group of people in the whole world — number one.   Number two, you’re not likely to be able to be exposed to something and spread it to mommy or daddy.  And it’s not likely mommy and daddy are able to spread it to you either.  So     Oh, you’re getting old.   Second grade.  Well, has your school — have you been in school, honey?     No.  See, that’s — that’s, kind of, a scary thing too: You don’t get to go to school; you don’t get to see your friends.   And so what a lot of kids — and  MR. COOPER:  You know, let me ask you —  — let me ask you, just for folks who are watching out there — there are a lot of people who are scared, and there’s a lot of people —    Sure.  MR. COOPER:  — who are hurting.  When do you think this pandemic is —    Well, you know, all the experts, all the committee that  But let me tell you what  MR. COOPER:  Have antibodies.    And have antibodies.  And so, if that works that way — as my mother would say, with the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbors — that by next Christmas,  So  We don’t know for certain, but it is highly unlikely that by the beginning of next year’s school — traditional school year in September, we are not significantly better off than we are today, but it matters.  It matters whether you continue to wear that mask.  It matters whether you continue to socially distance.  It matters whether you wash your hands with hot water.  It — those things matter.  They matter.  And that can save a lot of lives while we’re getting to this point, we get to herd immunity.   MR. COOPER:  You’ve made —   And so the thing we haven’t talked about — and I’m not going to go on because  Well, the fact is that the economy now has to be dealt with.  And what is — look at all the people.  You have over 10 million people unemployed.  We need unemployment insurance.  We need to make sure that, you know, you have — 40 percent of the children in America are — talk about food shortage — 60 percent of — did you ever think you’d see a day, Milwaukee — you’d see in the last six months, people lining up in their automobiles for an hour, for as far as you can see, to get a bag of food?  What —  We promised — look at all the people who are on the verge of being kicked out of their apartments because they cannot afford — they cannot afford the rent.  What happens when that happens?  Everything .  Look at all the mom-and-pop landlords that are in real trouble if we don’t subsidize this in the meantime.  Look at all the people who are on the verge of missing — and how many people have missed their last two mortgage payments and are able to be foreclosed on.  That’s why  Look at all the people who’ve lost their insurance.  How many — I’m not asking for a show of hands.  How many of you had jobs with corporations or companies that provided healthcare?  The  So there’s a lot — so  MR. COOPER:  This is — this is Randy Lange, an independent who supported Donald Trump in 2020.  Randy is the co-owner of a woodworking company here in Milwaukee.   Randy, welcome.      Well, first of all, the South is not much different than the Midwest in that regard as well.  But here’s the thing: If you look back over the last 40 years, as minimum wages increased, people haven’t — the end — the end result of net employment hasn’t changed.  The vast majority of economists — and there are studies that show that by increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour, it could have an impact on — on a number of businesses, but it would be de minimis, et cetera.   Here’s the deal: It’s about doing it gradually.  We’re at $7.25 an hour.  No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty.  No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty.    But it’s totally legitimate for small-business owners to be concerned about how that changes.  For example, if it went — if we gradually increased it — when we indexed it at $7.20, if we kept it indexed by — to inflation, people would be making 20 bucks an hour right now.  That’s what it would be.  MR. COOPER:  The Congressional Budget Office says that a $15 minimum wage would lift 900,000 people out of poverty but would also cause 1.4 million people their jobs.  Is that —    Yes, but there’s also — if you read that whole thing about Pinocchios and all the rest — there are also an equal number of studies that say that’s not — that wouldn’t have that effect, and particularly as you do it in terms of how gradually you do it.  So let’s say — you said you’re going to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour, between now and the year 2025, to $12 an hour, to $13 — you double someone’s pay — and the impact on business would be absolutely diminished, and it would grow the GDP, and it would grow and it would generate economic growth.   But it’s not illegitimate as a small-business person to worry about whether or not increasing it at one fell swoop would have that impact.   MR. COOPER:   Tim, welcome.          Change it drastically, first of all, by making sure we have inspectors general.  You may remember when the first bill passed, you may remember there was a guy running, saying, “What’s going to happen is the banks aren’t going to lend you the money.  They’re going to ask you a question, ‘Do you have your credit with us?  How many loans do you have with us?  What is your — what credit cards do you have with us?  How…”  Because even though they were being underwritten, and we bailed their rear ends out — last time out, they weren’t — it was too much trouble to lend to you.   What did the President do?  And  So what I’m doing is I’m providing $60 billion for you to be able to make capital investments in order to be able to open safely and make sure you’re in a position that you can do the things that are recommended.  If you’ve noticed, there’s been very little federal direction for you all as to how to safely open your businesses.  Yet, you know, if you’re able to test your employees, if you’re able to be in a situation if you — if you serve people, you have Plexiglas dividers; if you — a whole range.  If you’re able to have everybody with a — with a mask and the like, you can do so much to safely open, but you don’t get that direction.   So, the money,  So what I’d like to do is, if you are willing to give me an address, lay out for you precisely — without taking more time, I’m going to get in trouble; I’m supposed only took two minutes in an answer — is to let you know exactly how that $60 billion in part of the recovery package will go to small businesses.    MR. COOPER:  Right.  We’re going to take a quick break.  When we get back, we’ll have more questions for the President of the United States, Joe Biden.  We’ll be right back.      MR. COOPER:  And welcome back.  We’re live at a  Thanks so much for — for being here.  We — before we get back into — to the audience,  Before the Senate voted to acquit the former President in the impeachment trial, you said you were anxious to see if Republican senators would stand up.  Only seven did.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the rest “cowards.”  Do you agree with her?    I’m not going to call names out.   MR. COOPER:  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the former President is, quote, “still liable for everything he did while he was in office.”  If your Department of Justice wanted to investigate him, would you allow them to proceed?     MR. COOPER:   Joel, thanks for being here.     I’m not bad at the literature part, but after five years of French,       MR. COOPER:  It would be a shonda if you didn’t.  But —      It is complex, it’s wide ranging, and it’s real.  You may —  And so  You may remember in one of my debates with the former President,  MR. COOPER:   James, welcome.    James, if     About as big as a mountain.   So my question to you is: What will your administration do to correct these wrongs that we witnessed not just in Kenosha, but across this country?  And what will we do to bridge the gap between communities and their police?     Three things.  First of all,  Number two — we are pushing very hard, and  And so there’s a number of things relating to everything from no-knock warrants and — and a whole range of things you know.  But there’s legislation that’s being introduced separately.   But thirdly,  What happens now is, if you in fact are going to — you arrest someone because they had — and you want to charge them, you can charge them with robbery or armed robbery.  If you charge them with armed robbery, you get a lot more time than if you don’t charge with robbery.  But if you want to make sure that someone who doesn’t know much about their representation is able to , you engage in prosecutorial misconduct by offering them to plead to, essentially — it’s not the same — burglary, which gets them two years in probation and — so you don’t even get a trial.  You plead because you don’t have adequate representation.  You feel like everything is against you, and you’re in trouble.  When  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  So in order to make sure that you could not send people to jail for the same crime,  Well, what happens is prosecutors use that as a mechanism to send people to jail.  It makes it look like they’re — we’re dealing with mandatory sentencing, which it wasn’t designed to do at all.  It was designed to make sure that people were treated fairly.   There’s much — I’m sorry to go on.  There’s much more to talk about, but —  MR. COOPER:  Yeah.  We actually have a related question over here.  This is Dannie Evans, a pastor in Janesville, who works as a supervisor for the juvenile justice diversion program in Rock County.  He’s an independent, voted for Donald Trump in 2020.  He’s also a member the state’s 32-member Racial Disparity Task Force, created in the wake of the Jacob Blake shooting last summer.   Dannie, welcome.     Exactly.     By, number one, not defunding the police.  We have to put more money in police work so we have legitimate community policing and we’re in a situation where we change the legislation.  No one should go to jail for a drug offense.  No one should go to jail for the use of a drug.  They should go to drug rehabilitation.    Drug rehabilitation.  Number one.   We should be in a position where we change the system — of sentencing system — to one that relates to a notion of — they start telling you to — as related to making sure that what you do is you focus on making sure that there’s rehabilitation.  The idea that we don’t have people in prison systems learning how to be — spending the money — learning how to be mechanics, learning how to be cooks, learning how to have a profession when you get out; the idea that we deny someone, who served their time, access to Pell Grants, access to housing, access to — right now, as you well know, most places you get out of prison, you get 25 bucks and a bus ticket.  You end up back under the bridge exactly where you were before.   And the fact is that — the concern in many minority communities is black-on-black, Hispanic-on-Hispanic, not just —  But here’s the deal: There has to be much more serious –how can  And we also need to provide for — and it’s happening — more African American and more Hispanic police officers.  And, by the way, they don’t get it all right either, by a long shot.  But every cop, when they get up in the morning and put on that shield, has a right to expect to be able to go home to their family that night.  Conversely, every kid walking across the street wearing a hoodie is not a member of a gang and is about to knock somebody off.    So it’s about education.  I’d love to talk to you more about it because it’s — it is the answer, in my view — that and education — actually, access to education.   And one of the things that  So, there’s so many things that are built in institutionally that disadvantage African Americans and Latinos that we — in fact,  But the fact is that everyone has gotten a close-up look now and seen what’s happened.  That kid — that kid holding that camera for 8 minutes and 46 seconds awakened the whole world.  When  Dr. King — when my generation — when  And I’m going to say something that’s going to get me in trouble, which —  No, no, I’m not — I’m not being fac- — the reason I’m so hopeful is this new generation — they’re not like us.  They’re thinking differently.  They’re more open.  And we got to take advantage of it.    MR. COOPER:     I’m sorry.  MR. COOPER:    MR. COOPER:  Mequon, sorry.  LuVerda is a certified nurse, midwife.   Welcome.     Good evening.      You may remember how — trouble  You cannot function in our system without consensus, other than abusing power at the executive level.   So   MR. COOPER:  But let me —    And —   MR. COOPER:  Let me ask about — a question which does often divide many people in this country: immigration.     Yes.  MR. COOPER:  Your administration, along with congressional Democrats, expected to unveil an immigration reform bill just this week.  You want a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants.  Would you sign any immigration bill if it did not include that: a pathway for the roughly 11 million undocumented —    Yeah, there’s a whole range of things that relate to immigration, including the whole idea how you deal with — you know, what confuses people, is you talk about refugees, you talk about undocumented, you talk about people who are seeking asylum, and you talk about people who are coming from the — that are coming from camps or being held around the world.   And there are four different criteria for being able to come to the United States.  The vast majority of the people, those 11 million undocumented, they’re not Hispanics; they’re people who came on a visa — who was able to buy a ticket to get in a plane, and didn’t go home.  They didn’t come across the Rio Grande swimming — excuse me.      But all kidding aside.  So there are a lot of things that relate — but  And we don’t do that enough.  For the first time in American history, if you’re seeking asylum — meaning you’re being persecuted, you’re seeking asylum — you can’t do it from the United States.  You used to come, have an asylum officer determine whether or not you met the criteria, and send you back if you in fact — but you can’t even do that.  You’ve got to seek asylum from abroad.  MR. COOPER:  But just to be clear, though — and    Yes.   MR. COOPER:  — for ele- — roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants.    Yes.  MR. COOPER:  And that would be essential in any bill for you?     Well, yes.    But, by the way, if you came along and said to me, “In the meantime, we can work out a system whereby we’re going to…”  For example, we used to allow refugees — 125,000 refugees in the United States in a yearly basis.  It was as high as 250,000.  Trump cut it to 5,000.   Come with me into Sierra Leone.  Come with me into parts of Lebanon.  Come with me around the world and see people piled up in camps, kids dying, no way out, refugees fleeing from persecution.  We, the United States, used to do our part.  We were part of that.  We were — and, you know, that’s — you know, “send me your huddled masses.”  Come on.  And so  And it shows up — one of the reasons why we have been able to compete with the rest of the world so well is most of our major competitors are xenophobic.  You remember quite —  MR. COOPER:  You just talked to China’s President,    Yes, for two hours.  MR. COOPER:  What about the Uyghurs?  What about the human rights abuses in China?    We must speak up for human rights.  It’s who we are.  We can’t — my comment to him was — and  MR. COOPER:  You talked about this to him?      But my point was that when  And  MR. COOPER:  When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just — is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.?  Or is there any actual repercussions for China?    Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that.  What I’m doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other — other agencies that have an impact on their attitude.  China is trying very hard to become the world leader and to get that moniker.  And to be able to do that, they have to gain the confidence of other countries.  And as long as they’re engaged in activity that is contrary to basic human rights, it’s going to be hard for them to do that.  But it’s much more complicated than that.  I’m —  MR. COOPER:  Well, let me — let me bring it back to the United States.   Joycelyn, welcome.  Your question?     Good evening.     Me too.     You think I’m kidding.      But here’s what  And  And the thing  Thirdly, I’m going to change the position that we have now to allow for debt forgiveness — because it’s so hard to calculate — whereby you can now, depending on how much you make and what program you sought, you can work off that debt by the activity you have, and you cannot be charged more than  Each of my children graduated from school.   But my — my oldest son graduated, after undergraduate and graduate school, with $136,000 in debt after working 40 —  So  But my point is:  But  MR. COOPER:  Mr. President, let me ask you —    Because  MR. COOPER:  You have, over the years — over your career, you’ve obviously spent a great deal of time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, except now you’re living there and you’re President.  It’s been four weeks.  What’s it like?  How’s it different?     No, it’s — look, it’s — you know, I’ve only been President four weeks.  And sometimes — because things are moving so fast, not because of burden — it feels like four years.  It’s not because of the burden; it’s because there’s so much happening that you focus on.  You’re constantly focusing on one problem or opportunity, one right — ad seriatum.  But what happens is that it’s — what  MR. COOPER:  You’d never been in the Residence of the White House?    I’d only been upstairs in the — in the Yellow Room.  You know, the — the Oval upstairs.  MR. COOPER:     No.  And — but it’s — but, look, the people down there are wonderful.  And  MR. COOPER:  Is it different than you expected it to be, in some ways?    You know,  The Vice President’s residence was totally different.  You’re on 80 acres, overlooking the rest of the city.  And you can walk out, and there’s a swimming pool.  You can walk off a porch in the summer and jump in a pool, and — and, you know, go into work.  You can ride a bicycle around and never leave the property and work out.  And you can — but the White House is very different.   And  And it was interesting to hear these historians talk about what — what other presidents have gone through in the moments, and who were the people who stepped up to the ball, and who’s the people who didn’t.  And what you realize is the most consequential thing for me is — although I’ve known this watching seven presidents who  But  So it took away the sense of, “This is — my God, you know, I’m not Abraham Lincoln.  I’m not Franklin Roosevelt.  How do  MR. COOPER:  Have you picked up the phone and called any former president yet?     Yes,  MR. COOPER:  Do you want to say who?    No,  MR. COOPER:     No, but, look, it’s a — it’s the greatest honor  But one thing  And that’s where you pray for making sure that you’re looking at the impact on the country and a little bit of good luck at the judgment you’re making.   MR. COOPER:  Mr. President, thank you so much for joining us —    Thank you.  MR. COOPER:  — in this town hall.                                        11:44 A.M.  And the American Rescue Plan is — has multiple pieces.  The most important piece, in my view, is making sure we give them enough capacity to deal with the virus in their states and how we’re going to do that.  But equally consequential is the need to help the states economically, in terms of everything from unemployment to being able to make sure that they’re able to get kids back in schools and what role the federal government should play in helping getting that done.  And, you know, if — these folks are all on the frontlines.  They’ve been dealing with this crisis from day one.  It’s — I’m not making a political statement; it just it’s taken a while to adjust.  They’ve been left on their own, in many cases.   So  And what   We’re down here in Washington, and we meet with them.   And so thank you for being here.  And that’s what we’re going to be doing today.  Thank you all.  11:47 A.M.        Bethesda, Maryland   4:43 P.M.  And so  I’d like to start off by thanking Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci for hosting me today.   Our nation is fortunate to have both of you in this — in these critical roles.  And that goes for the world-class doctors, scientists, researchers here at the NIH.  And  To all — to all of you, your work made possible the remarkably rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines we have today.  It’s incredible.  Initially, people were talking years, if not decades, before we’d have a vaccine.   On behalf of a grateful nation — and  The devastation of this pandemic — the loss of life and livelihoods — hasn’t spared the scientific community: labs closed, research delayed, careers disrupted, especially for those in training.  Yet with every moment of despair in this past year, you and all the heroes and heroines on the frontlines of the — and the frontiers of this pandemic remind us who we are.  We are America.  We never give up.  We never give in.  We give back, and we follow the science and find the answers.  That’s what all of you do here.  That’s what we’ve seen all across the country.  The scientific community repurposed labs to work on COVID-19; developed therapeutics, new diagnostics technologies, and vaccines in record time.  And you’re highlighting lessons learned on the importance of pandemic preparedness, public-private partnerships, real-time data sharing, and most of all, speed and efficiency without compromising science and good conscience.  Look, you’re an incredible group of people.  I’ve been out here many times trying to help — trying to help my son who passed away with cancer.  You’re an incredible, incredible group of people.  And that’s not hyperbole.  We still — what we know is we still have a long way to go.  It’s no secret that the vaccination program was in much worse shape than my team and  While scientists did their job in discovering vaccines in record time, my predecessor — I’ll be very blunt about it — did not do his job in getting ready for the massive challenge of vaccinating hundreds of millions of Americans.  He didn’t order enough vaccines.  He didn’t mobilize enough people to administer the shots.  He didn’t set up federal vaccine centers where eligible people could go and get their shots.  When It’s going to take time to fix, to be blunt with you.   We started on day one.  We won’t have everything fixed for a while, but we’re going to fix it.  First, the vaccine.   That’s why, in the first three weeks that I’ve been in office, we’ve increased the supply of weekly vaccine shipments to the states by almost 30 percent.  That means millions more Americans will get vaccinated in February than the previous administration was on track to do.  But that’s just the start.  We bought more vaccines.  Two weeks ago,  Just this afternoon, we signed the final contracts for 100 million more Moderna and 100 million more Pfizer vaccines.  And we’re also able to move up the delivery dates with an additional 200 million vaccines to the end of July — faster than we expected.  And in further good news, both companies agreed — and we’re now contractually obligated — to expedite delivery of 100 million doses, that were promised by the end of June, to deliver them by the end of May.  That’s a month faster.  That means lives will be saved.  That means we’re now on track to have enough supply for 300 million Americans by the end of July.  It may not sound like the urgent progress we need, but let’s be clear: When  Within three weeks, round-the-clock work with so many people — people standing behind me and in front of me — we’ve now purchased enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all Americans.  And now we’re working to get those vaccines into the arms of millions of people.  In just three weeks, you deployed over 1,000 federal staff to vaccination sites around the country.  We’re helping give shots and set up and speed vaccination operations.  To date, we’ve also provided $3 billion to 37 states and territories and tribes to bolster existing vaccination centers and create more of the centers to administer — where we administer the vaccine.   For example, three days ago, Vice President Harris and I, we had a virtual tour of a federally supported vaccine center in a parking lot of the Arizona Cardinal Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.  It’s open 24/7.   Folks who are eligible can call by phone or sign up online for an appointment.  They literally drive in, stay in their cars, get a shot, get a card, and schedule the next shot.  On average, it’s about 30 minutes from start to finish.   In just three weeks, the site has administered 160,000 doses, now averaging 8,000 vaccinations through the day and night.  Look, it’s coordination between state and federal government, and the private sector partnership is essential.  One of the nurses coordinating the effort in Arizona said the work was like administering — and  During the Super Bowl, we got a call from the NFL.  The commissioner of football, Goodell, said we could have access to all 30 of the  We just announced we’ve worked with the governors to set up these new federally run sites in California, New York, Texas, with many more to come.  We’re going to target communities that have been the hardest hit, and it will be staffed by our military; the Federal Emergency Management Association [Agency] —  When  And for folks who can’t get to a pharmacy, we’re deploying mobile units and sending vaccinat- — vaccines to community health centers — federally run community health centers — to take care of the poorest of the poor, that reach the hardest-hit in those underserved areas in the country — black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities.  This is an important piece to ensure racial equity remains at the center of our COVID-19 response, which is something,  Another point of progress is we’re deploying more vaccinators.  We’re now allowing retired doctors and nurses to come back and administer shots.  We’re deploying federal vaccinators, and over the last three weeks, we put hundreds of new vaccinators in the field and are lining up thousands more.  These include medical personnel from our Commissioned Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as personnel from FEMA, the Defense Department, and more departments to come.   All told, we’re on track to surpass the goal  But like  We remain in the teeth of this pandemic.  January of 2021 was the deadliest month we’ve had.  We lost over 100,000 — 100,000 of our fellow citizens.  We’re on track to cross 500,000 dead Americans this next month.  The new strains emerging create immense challenges, and masking is still the easiest thing to do to save lives.  But we need everyone to mask up.   And, by the way,  That’s why  Mask up, America.  Mask up.  And to really get ahead of this pandemic instead of chasing it, we need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan.  And I’m grateful that the Senate and the House are moving quickly.  And my hope is that we’ll get Republicans, as well as Democrats, to support us.   But we can’t wait.  People are dying every minute from this pandemic.  And we’re suffering a profound economic crisis that the pandemic has created.  Every major economist in the country — left, right, and center — says we can’t go big enough here.  And if we want to get our economy back in shape, we’ve got to move quickly.   How many of you out there don’t have enough food to eat?  How many of you out there are worried whether you can pay next month’s rent or pay your mortgage?  How many of you out there have a child at home because a school is not open and you have to make the difficult choice of staying home with your child or going to work if you have a job?  This is not who we are.  In the United States of America, we take care of our own.   And job number one of the American Rescue Plan is fighting the pandemic.  It puts $160 billion into our national  You know, there’s simply nothing more important than getting the resources we need to vaccinate people in this country as quickly as possible — as quickly as possible.  We’re not going to get our economy back in shape and millions of people back to work until we beat this virus.   As  We’re in a national emergency.   And for God’s sakes, we have to remember who we are: We are the United States of America.  We can do this.  We have the resources.  We just have to choose to use them.   We have to do what all of you do here at  May God bless you all.  And may God bless everyone here at    5:01 P.M.        Bethesda, Maryland    4:08 P.M.   Jeff, when will it be by?  By June, we’ll have — how much will we have?   MR. ZIENTS:  We’ll have 400 million does by June, which is enough to vaccinate 200 million Americans.  And then you ordered another 200 million doses —      Yeah.   MR. ZIENTS:  — to be delivered this summer.    DR. FAUCI:  That’s the best way to stop the mutations.      No,   But what   And   DR. COLLINS:  It just feels like three years.       But what happened is that we were led to — if you ever hear anybody talking about transitions between pres- — between presidents, it’s really important, because we didn’t have any access to the transition.  And you know, Dr. Fauci, about it.  And so we thought, and we were led to believe, there was a lot more vaccine available than there was.   And when   But to get to the place where — and these guys legitimately always ask me — is: “When will we have enough vaccine to have that 300-plus million people?”  And even though we’ve increased by close to 600 million — promises of the vaccine — we’re going to be in a position where it’s going to be — it’s not going to be by the end of the summer.  And so all the Americans who are looking for it — and that’s why   And so, this is the — it’s an ama- — and, by the way, every department is jumping in.  The Defense Department over there, they jumped right in like they did with dealing with Ebola before, in Africa.  They’re probably going to have, literally, over a hundred thou- —            Well, we talked about the variants, and I’ll — rather than Joe Biden, the lawyer, explain the variants —        DR. FAUCI:  The 117 — that’s the        The South African variant is a little bit more problematic.  It diminishes the capability of the vaccines to induce the virus’s — the antibodies that would suppress it.  But it doesn’t completely eliminate it, and we know that from studies with other vaccines in South Africa, where it went down to maybe 50 percent efficacy.  But it was very good in preventing severe disease.  In fact, there were no hospitalizations or deaths.        The bottom line is: We take it seriously.  We’re following it.  And if necessary, we’re able to make boosts that reflect the variants in question.                 No, I’m not.         So we were under the distinct impression there was significantly more vaccine available to begin to be distributed; that it was a distribution problem — which it is and was, but that wasn’t the main problem; it was having enough.  And then getting — you know, there’s a big difference — the logistical difference between having a vaccine sent to the States in bulk and refrigerated, and having vaccinators with the paraphernalia to put it into a vial and stick it in someone’s arm — is a very different and logistical problem — difficult problem.        So there’s the vaccine.  There is the access to the vaccine, in terms of how you get it where it has to be.  That is a giant logistical issue, and we’re solving that now.        For example, we are, as of — was it today, Jeff?  We’re doing — we’re making sure that all these federal systems, community —        MR. ZIENTS:  Community health centers.          — community health centers that are federally run — we are getting them — what day are we getting —        MR. ZIENTS:  Starting next week.          Starting next week, they’ll get —        MR. ZIENTS:  And pharmacies start today.          And the pharmacies start today.  We thought, by listening — at least my team did — between the time we were elected and the time somebody recognized we were elected, that we thought that it was well underway; that the drugstores were beginning — you know, all the places — the Walmarts of the world — were ready.  But it turned out they weren’t.  And so we — it’s been a hell of a learning process.         But you have done an enormous, enor- — all — every other scientist I’ve talked to across the board said the idea that it would end in less than a year — you’d come up with a vaccine —                                                   10:23 A.M.  We want to talk about infrastructure, and this committee is central to everything that’s going to happen.  I’ve been around long enough — and Tom and Jim and all of us — that — it used to be that infrastructure wasn’t a Democrat or Republican issue.  There are not many Republican or Democratic roads and bridges, and so on.  So we’re going to talk about infrastructure.  And  Again, it’s not —     Well, that’s true.  That’s true.  And it’s named after Bill Roth.     That’s right.  And I’ll tell you what — and Tom climbs up all the time.  But all kidding aside, there’s — there’s a lot we have to do.  And  Last night,  And  And so what I’d like to — I’m going to talk to these folks about, which is the key committee, is how we begin this.  I’ve laid out what  So thank you all for coming in.           I, like other Americans, watched the news.   Thank you.  Thank you very much.   10:28 A.M.        Arlington, Virginia  3:20 P.M. Before It’s been a busy day.  Earlier, So often, our Armed Forces and the Department of Defense staff are how the rest of the world encounters America.  And you all know as well as anyone that our country is safer and stronger when we lead not just with the example of our power, but with the power of our example.  As your Commander-in-Chief, But So There is no aspect of our agenda of the 21st century leadership where the women and men of the Defense Department do not have a role — whether it’s helping curb the pandemic here at home and around the world; or addressing the real threats of climate change that already is costing us billions in impacts on our bases, on our national security; or being part of an ongoing fight for racial justice.  You are essential to how we must rethink and reprioritize our security to meet the challenges of this century, not the last.  We need to take on the dangers and opportunities of emerging technologies, enhance our capabilities in cyberspace, ensure that we are positioned to lead in a new era of competition, from deep sea to outer space.  And we need to meet the growing challenges posed by China to keep the peace and defend our interests in the Indo-Pacific and globally.  Today, The task force will work quickly, drawing on civilian and military experts across the Department, to provide, within the next few months, recommendations to Senator [Secretary] Austin on key priorities and decision points so that we can chart a strong path forward on China-related matters.  It will require a whole-of-government effort, bipartisan cooperation in Congress, and strong alliances and partnerships.  That’s how we’ll meet the China challenge and ensure the American people win the competition of the future.  You know, to the incredible individuals who serve in our Armed Forces: You are unquestionably part of the finest fighting force in the history of the world.  You’re warriors.  The work you do each and every day is vital to ensuring the American people — your families, friends, and loved ones — are able to live in peace and security and growing prosperity.  And for those of you who raise your hands and sign up to wear the uniform of the United States: We owe you an incredible debt.   I’ve said for many years, less than one percent of Americans do what you do: put yourself on the line for the rest of the 99 percent of the Americans you represent.  The 99 percent of us owe you.  We owe it to you to keep the faith with our sacred obligation to properly prepare and equip you when we send you into harm’s way, and to care for you and your families, both while you are deployed and after you return home.  You’re incredible heroes and incredible patriots.  As I’ve said, this is personal for me.  The Biden family is a military family.  We learned firsthand some of what your loved ones experienced when Beau was deployed to Iraq for a year with his unit in the Delaware National Guard.  We dealt with the stress of his absence and the daily joys — from the daily joys of life.  And we worried constantly about his safe return.  We felt overwhelming pride in his courage and his patriotism.    You are all the best our country has to offer.  You live by a creed of selfless sacrifice.  And for many of you, the journey to service has not been easy.  February is Black History Month, as the Vice President pointed out.  Before we leave today, Vice President Harris and But those contributions have nevertheless helped push our country toward greater equality.  From the bravery of the free and enslaved descendants of Africans who fought with the colonial forces in our revolution; to the black regiments that joined to fight for the Union and for their own freedom in the Civil War; to the Buffalo soldiers, including Henry O. Flipper, the first African American graduate of West Point; and Cathay Williams, the first African American woman — Cathay — who enlisted in the United States Army.   Imagine the incredible love it must have taken for the proud Tuskegee Airmen to fly more than 15,000 sorties in battle, when their own freedom was not fully realized in their own country.  Imagine the determination of Roscoe Robinson, who started at West Point one year before Harry Truman issued the order to officially desegregate the Armed Forces, and who rose to become the first African American four-star general.  Imagine the bravery of the 22 African Americans awarded the Medal of Honor for their service in the Vietnam War while struggling for civil rights at home was continuing.   It’s all part of a long history of barrier-breaking service.  Right now, more than 40 percent of our active-duty forces are people of color.  And it’s long past time that the full diversity and full strength of our force is reflected at every level of this Department, including our Secretary of Defense.   This organization thrives and succeeds because of our people.  So the final point I’d like to make today is to give you my personal commitment that this administration — from myself and the Vice President Harris to Secretary Austin on down — is dedicated to ensuring that every single person is treated with dignity and respect.  That’s why we moved so quickly to overturn the discriminary — discriminatory ban on transgender service, and why General Austin’s first memo was a directive to take sexual assault in the military seriously.  Every single person, no matter their gender identity, sexual orientation, race, or religious background, deserves to feel safe in the ranks and to have their contributions valued.  It’s on all of us to stand up, to speak out when you see someone being abused.  This is an organization that’s defined American — excuse me, defeated American enemies on land, sea, and air, and been defined by the way we treat others.  So So, thank you for welcoming us, Secretary Austin.  It’s good to be back in the Pentagon.  Thank you for what you do for this country.  May God bless you and protect you, and may God protect our troops deployed around the world, every single one of you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.                                             Eisenhower Executive Office Building  1:22 P.M. As you know, the assault on Burma’s transition to democracy remains an issue of deep bipartisan concern.  We’ve consulted at length, for example, with Senator McConnell, who’s had a very keen interest in this, and his team.  And we welcomed their helpful insights.  We’ve also been in close contact with our allies and partners around the world, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, driving vigorous diplomatic outreach to help coordinate an international response to what happened.    Last week, the United States helped bring together the U.N. Security Council, which issued a strong statement in support of Burmese democracy.  And this week, we will use our renewed engagement on the Human Rights Council to strengthen the world’s commitment to human rights in Burma.  Today, The military must relinquish the power it seized and demonstrate respect for the will of the people of Burma as expressed in their November 8th election.  So today, I’m announcing a series — a series of actions that we’re taking to begin imposing consequences on the leaders of the coup.  The U.S. government is taking steps to prevent the generals from improperly having access to the $1 billion in Burmese government funds held in the United States.  And today, I’ve approved a new executive order —  — excuse me — a new executive order enabling us to immediately sanction the military leaders who directed the coup, their business interests, as well as close family members.  We will identify a first round of targets this week.  And we’re also going to impose strong export controls.  And we’re freezing U.S. assets that benefit the Burmese government, while maintaining our support for healthcare, civil society groups, and other areas that benefit the people of Burma directly.  And, finally, as protests grow, violence against those asserting their democratic rights is unacceptable, and we’re going to keep calling it out.  The people of Burma are making their voices heard.  And the world is watching.  We’ll be ready to impose additional measures, and we’ll continue to work with our international partners to urge other nations to join us in these efforts.  So                                                 2:05 P.M.   As Secretary Yellen has pointed out, we have a scarring effect that may be going on and can get worse.  We have kids not in school.  There’s a whole range of issues, but  As you know, I’ve met for a long time with my Republican colleagues.  I’ve been exchanging correspondence with them and telephone calls, as well, to see if there’s any way we can follow up beyond where we are, and meeting with the members of the House and the Senate as well.  And  As you know, you’ve been through it all in detail with me on what we’re doing on the coronavilus [sic] — virus and the funding mechanisms that exist within this package, as well as we have to deal at the same time with the — with the employment.  We have to deal at the same time with business and growth of the economy.  We can’t let one wait.  We can’t get everybody well and then move on the economy.  We have to move quickly on both.  And I’m anxious to hear what these business leaders have to say about how they think I’m approaching this issue, we’re approaching this issue, and to see if we can find some common ground.   So, thank you all for coming in.          So, thank you very, very much.  Appreciate it.     Yes.     Thanks, everybody.                                    MR. ZIENTS:  Good afternoon, Mr. President and Madam Vice President.  On your second day in office, you announced a comprehensive national strategy to fight the pandemic.  Importantly, you called for a whole-of-government approach.  Central to that strategy, you directed your team to activate the full resources of the federal government to get more shots in arms.  We immediately got to work.  First, to increase vaccine supply.  Second, to get more vaccinators in the field.  And third, to create more places where Americans can get vaccinated.  We’re putting equity front and center, partnering with states to increase vaccinations in the hardest-hit and hard-to- reach communities.  We’re building new community vaccination centers from the ground up — in stadiums, community centers, parking lots, and mobile units — in states ranging from California, to Ohio, to New York.  And we’ve expedited financial support to increase capacity at existing community vaccination centers nationwide, with over $2.2 billion in funding across 32 states, tribes, and territories.  Today, we want to show you what it looks like on the ground, in Glendale, Arizona.  We’re going to do a tour of State Farm Stadium, which started giving its first shots on January 11.  The State of Arizona is one of the first states to reach out to ask for federal help from your administration.  On January 21st, we decided to deploy 25  Since opening, the site has administered over 160,000 doses, now averaging 8,000 vaccinations a day.  This stadium is a model for other communities across the country on how they can operate in partnership with the federal government to vaccinate more people.  Our support to the state goes beyond State Farm Stadium.  We’ve deployed almost 300 federal personnel from  At the request of state and local leaders across the country, we’ve made the cost to build these sites fully reimbursable through FEMA.  Just yesterday,  Here’s a look at the site you’re going to see today.  There’s a great team on the ground who’s going to walk you through it.   So now let me introduce you to Dr. Christ, the Director of the Arizona Department of Health Services.   Dr.  Christ, over to you.   DR. CHRIST:  Good afternoon, and we are so honored to have you here at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.   So, State Farm Stadium is the first 24/7 vaccination site in Arizona.  We have a dashboard that we monitor all of our data that we look at.  And so we are averaging between 8,000 and 9,000 vaccines per day; that currently is both first and second doses.  It’s about 350 to 400 vaccines per hour.  And like was said, we’ve vaccinated almost 170,000 times out here at State Farm Stadium.  This one site is responsible for over 18 percent of all of the vaccines delivered in Arizona since we started.  Our full capacity, though, here is 12,000 vaccines per day.   Let me take you over to the sitemap.  So we have an electronic registration system that people can either log in online and sign up, or they can call a call center if they’re not comfortable working on the web.  But they will come in, they will have an appointment, they will get checked in, and we will make sure that they are registered at the data verification.  It’s all done electronically.  They will come around to our vaccination tents where they receive their vaccine, and then are asked to stay on for about 15 to 30 minutes.   This is all done in the comfort of their own car, which is really important, potentially, as we head into the warmer months here in Arizona, and it allows for our vulnerable residents to stay socially distanced.   During their 15 to 30 minutes that they are spending with us to make sure that they’re safe, we are registering them for their second-dose appointment, as well as getting them their vaccine card.   We also have a really strong partner in Walgreens.  They are set up, and they manage a 24/7 pharmacy onsite in State Farm Stadium.  And the main goal of this site was to really accelerate getting vaccine into the arms of Arizonans.  This has accelerated our efforts here in Arizona.  And we weren’t sure what a 24/7 site would look like.  We weren’t sure that we would have the demand that we — that we needed.  However, our sites and appointments book up very quickly, and our flow through the night is just the same as it is during the day.  So we’re running about 350 to 400 people through per hour.   What that has helped with is our — the 24/7 nature of this operation allows us to ensure that no dose expires or goes unused.  So we’ve also got plans with our other pods in the valley that they can transfer a vaccine to us to make sure that they’re not going to expire doses as well.   We are still in our Phase 1 One of the other things that we’ve found really helps us keep up with our vaccine supply is to offer plus-ones.  So that is a clinical decision that is offered to somebody else who may have accompanied that individual in the car, whether it’s a caretaker, a family member.  We’re trying to get as many vaccines into the arms of Arizonans, so we want to make sure that all of those around some of our vulnerable residents are protected.   The other thing: We have a very large influx of winter visitors and migrant agricultural workers to Arizona this time of year.  So Arizona has made the decision not to restrict vaccination to residents.  You can be from anywhere in the United States, and we will still vaccinate you if you are able to get a partnership.   And the final thing  And this site was developed to be replicable, so we can scale it up and we can send it to other sites.  In fact, last week, we just opened our second state-operated site at Phoenix Municipal Stadium.  We’re running about 2,000 to 3,000, but it has the same capacity as State Farm Stadium does, at 12,000.   And in the next couple of weeks, we will be opening up our third pod down in Pima County, which is Tucson, our second most populous county here in Arizona.   I’m happy to take any questions that you may have.     Doctor, let me ask you — this is Joe Biden.  Let me ask you a question.  Were you able to do this — would you be able to do this without federal help?  The reason  DR. CHRIST:  So, without the federal funding and without the federal partnership, this would be a huge logistical lift.  And so, the fact that we’ve got such great partnership with our federal partners — whether it’s FEMA, whether it’s  And so, without that funding and the vaccine and the vaccinators that have come out here, along with all of the logistical support that we’ve gotten — it’s a huge lift to put something like this together.     Why did you decide on this site for the drive-thru?  DR. CHRIST:  So that is a great question, Mr. President.  One of the things is our partnership with the Arizona Cardinals.  So Michael Bidwill and the Cardinals have been strong partners throughout the  But it’s also got great freeway access.  Everybody knows where it is.  We can do freeway signs so that people can easily navigate into the parking lot.  And with the     One last question.  Do you —  DR. CHRIST:  Yes, it’s a clinical decision made onsite, at the time.  It depends on our vaccine supply and the capacity that we have at the site to be able to register that additional person.  But we really try.   We know that people are in constant contact with family members and loved ones.  And the more we can do to surround them with vaccinated people, like their caretaker, it just keeps people safer.     Well, one of the things you may recall — the Vice President and  And so because of folks like you, who are dedicated — and   How are you reaching out to your hardest-hit communities and those who may have a difficult time with transportation or just, proportionally, are some of the hardest hit but maybe not receiving the vaccine at the greatest numbers?  What kind of outreach are you doing?    We lost you, Doc.   DR. CHRIST:  Am    You’re good.    DR. CHRIST:  Okay, perfect.  Okay, sorry — the technical.   So that is a really great question, Madam Vice President, and something that, here in Arizona, we feel strongly about.  So this is just one portion of our state vaccination plan.  So we are looking to partner with community leaders to put community-based pods in some of those hard-to-reach and targeted  We’re also working with our state’s Medicaid program to ensure that we’ve got non-medical transport available that they can use if they want to come out here to one of these sites or any other sites.  And we’re also taking advantage of the CDC’s retail pharmacy partnership to make sure that we’re getting those vaccines into pharmacies in hard-hit areas, as well as our community health centers.   And so that’s just a little bit about the plan, but we definitely are trying to target those populations because we know how at risk they are.   DR. CHRIST:  So, we here are very surprised at how willing people are to get that second-dose vaccine.  So we’ve been — that was one of our lessons learned here at State Farm Stadium: We register people for their second dose before they actually leave this site.  And prior, we had been just telling them we would email them.   That has been great.  We have a high demand for second dose.  And we actually take people who are looking to get their second dose, but can’t find it somewhere else, here at State Farm as walk-ins.     Doing a great job, Doc.  DR. CHRIST:  All right, well, now    Thank you.  MS. HAYES:  Hi, I’m Brittney Hayes.  I’m with Arizona State University.  I’m the head charge nurse here at the vaccination pod at State Farm Stadium.  So I’m just going to walk you guys through the process.  Let’s see —  Once the cars are all checked in, then they come through to the tent, where  And then my vaccinator: My vaccinator is the first clinical person that a patron sees as they come through.  And they are in charge of an assessment — pretty much looking for if there are people ill, if we have allergies, anything that we need to note so we can know if they need to stay for 15 to 30 minutes, if they’re eligible for the vaccine.  And they ensure — they are  to give the vaccine using the proper technique and safety.   So safety is a big — big part of what I’m in charge of here, ensuring that sharps containers are used properly,  So, some of the challenges that  And  And then, as far as other challenges, we are a 24/7 site, so the no production has been a challenge for me.  So we have to implement things on the fly and how we communicate that with 50 people that are working your site.  So  And then, as far as some of the successes,  Back to you.    We’re really proud of you.  MS. HAYES:  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.    No,  Tell me about the number of volunteers.  Are these pure volunteers?  Do they get per diem or are they pure volunteers?  MS. HAYES:   for our volunteers.  I’m not exactly sure everything that goes into that process, but over 50 percent of probably what is on my vaccination pods here are volunteers.  All of our datafication people are volunteers.    And when someone comes through in a vehicle, do they have to demonstrate proof of eligibility or have they also been cleared before they get to that tent?  MS. HAYES:  That’s what I’m for — the charge nurse.     Now, in Arizona, what is the age eligibility for coming through that tent?  MS. HAYES:  So we are — since we are doing the Pfizer vaccine, it is 16 and over, but the 16 and over have to be — the appointment needs to be made online.  If they are a walk-in, it does have to be 18 or older due to them just being minors.    Right.  And what do you hear from the folks coming through that get the vaccine — that actually get the shot in their arm?  What are the kind of things you most often hear from them or your — your volunteers hear?  S. HAYES:  They’re amaz- — yeah, no.  I’m sorry.  They’re amazed by the process, the smoothness.     Last question  MS. HAYES:  That’s a great question.  So, the collaboration that    Are you a freshman at the university?    MS. HAYES:  No.  No.   No.    You look like a freshman.  MS. HAYES:  Why, thank you.   MS. HAYES:  Absolutely.  And I’m more than happy to be here.    I’m going to turn it over to the Vice President.  She’s got the tough questions.  MS. HAYES:  Oh, okay.   MS. HAYES:  Hi.    So what would your advice be to others who are setting up an operation like yours?  What did you learn worked and what didn’t work?  So we can learn from — from whatever you have experienced.  MS. HAYES:   MS. HAYES:  — and being able to keep our patrons and staff safe.   Thank you.  MS. HAYES:  Thank you.    And you’re a — are you a nurse?   MS. HAYES:     Well,          That’s the God’s truth.  Thank you for all you do.  MS. HAYES:  Thank you very much.    Thank you.  Okay.  Keep it going.  MS. HAYES:  I’m going to turn it back to Dr. Christ.    Okay.   DR. CHRIST:  Thank you so much, Brittney.  She is one of our most dedicated nurses out here, but we have such a great team behind us.  You can see — this is the site behind us.  It takes about 30 minutes to go, from the time you pull on to the time you leave.  But with me,  MS. LITTRELL:  Good afternoon, Mr. President and Madam Vice President.  It is such an honor today to be a part of this state’s initiative to stand up what  The one thing that  So what we’re going to take back when we operate and we open those two sites in Oakland and in Los Angeles is we are going to provide mobile teams.  And these mobile teams are going to be able to reach those who are not able to drive or get to a vaccination center.  We also just want to emphasize that  We’re also supplemental — providing food support also.  Meals on — similar to like what we normally know is Meals on Wheels, but you’re able to get food to those who are not also able to get out.   Of course, we cannot do this big lift of standing up by scratch.  As you can see, we’re showing you today an efficient and effective operation.  In order for us to replicate this and to be able to open timely so that we can reach your 100 day goal, we are partnering with the Department of Defense, also the United States Department of Agriculture, and Health and Human Services to be able for us to replicate what we see and what we have learned here today.   With that, sir,    Yep.  MS. LITTRELL:  So as we support the Navajo Nation, we are going to stand up four vaccination centers.  This will help increase their access to the vaccination, as well as take the burden off of their tribal members from having to drive in these austere winter conditions that they are experiencing right now.  And then we also have our  We also want to help open schools safely.  So, bottom line: We want to help those at risk and we want to get back to where people can move around, get around, and be educated as well.  With that,  So with that,    Well, thank you.    MS. LITTRELL:     Well, first of all, thank you.  You’re doing one heck of a job.  One of the things that when we started to try to figure out what we were going to do when we came into office, because there wasn’t much of a transition — we didn’t have — we weren’t given a lot of information.  And some of the information we had turned out not to be accurate in terms of vaccine supplies.  And — and we met virtually with all the governors, and the governors basically said, “Just send us the vaccine; we’ll take care of it.”  And the fact is,  And so, one of the first things we did was we called in  So   And lastly, one of the most important things for us — and you mentioned what’s happening on the Navajo tribe; I’ve met with the leaders — is that it really — it really does matter that we have access to the people who are most in need but are — and most affected by the  But   MS. LITTRELL:  Sure.   But after talking with  So we’re going to maximize as much as we possibly can and not just lean on our own understanding, our own   MS. LITTRELL:  Thank you, ma’am.    General, how you doing?     Better for seeing you, man.   In Arizona, as you know, we have 15 counties and 22 tribes that have sovereign lands inside the borders of Arizona.  And those 37 entities work collaboratively with our agency.   And  Couldn’t be prouder of the partnership we have not only with our federal partners, but obviously our local county hospitals, the incident command teams, and then the guidance that we get from Dr. Christ and her team working together.   And when we were brought into this problem set once the vaccine rolled out, from a military perspective we just felt that we had to increase volume.  And so the governor’s office and Dr. Christ proposed a partnership here at State Farm Stadium.  We put a team of planners together with all of health services and brought in a whole lot of volunteers.   And as you can see, over half of this is now staffed by volunteers.  We feed them while they’re here.  We provide them a work rest cycle.  But literally, the idea is to get this functioning with as little help from the Guard as possible so we can replicate this in all 15 counties all around the state.  And we couldn’t do it without the federal partnership, especially the financial resources and obviously the delivery of the vaccine.   So thanks for all you’re doing there on the federal team, and    Well, you sure have it figured out at that spot, General.  And thank you for all you’ve done, and thank you for what you do.  And you probably have been deployed with your group several times in the last 10 years, so thank you for that as well.      Madam Vice President.   Thank you.     And, Dr. Christ, thank you for the — for the tour and to meet some of your frontline workers.   And this is the kind of partnership between the federal and state governments that  And we’re optimistic that we have enough — we’ll have enough of the vaccine in the pipeline to be able to provide shots for over — including double shots for over 300 million people before we get through the summer.  At least that’s our hope.  And it includes getting vaccines to the pharmacies you pointed out to me earlier, Doc, and vaccination centers like the one you have there.  And we’re going to need — if we need more vaccinators, we’ll send them, we’ll find them for you.  So let us know.   And again,  You know, big or small, we’re going to do whatever it takes to reach and surpass our goal of over 100 million in 100 days.  And there’s a lot to do, and it’s going to take time.  We’re going to face some setbacks along the way, including the complication of the strains that we’re seeing from South Africa and other places.  But  Madam Vice President.   So thank you.  Together with Governor Ducey, Senator Sinema, and Kelly, and so many others,  So thank you all.    There’s no such thing as a red state or a blue state when it comes to COVID.  There’s no such thing as Democrat or Republican —     — when it comes to COVID.  When we stand united, there’s not a damn thing we’ve been unable to do.  And you’re the — you’re a perfect example of that.   So thanks again.  Stay safe.  Stay safe.  And thank you.   3:17 P.M.         12:22 P.M.  I’m accompanied by the Vice President and the Secretary of Treasury, Janet Yellen, and  And the January jobs numbers came out today.  And while we are grateful for everyone who found work and is earning a paycheck, it is very clear our economy is still in trouble.  We added just 6,000 private sector jobs in the country last month.  Overall, we added 49,000 jobs.  And this at a time when we have more than 10 million people out of work, 4 million people have been out of work for six months or longer, and 2.5 million women have been driven from the workforce.  Fifteen million Americans are behind in their rental payments.  Twenty-four million adults and twelve million children literally don’t have enough food to eat.  These aren’t Democrats or Republicans — they’re Americans.  And they’re suffering.  And they’re suffering not because of anything they did.  Through no fault of their own, they’re suffering.    Suicides are up.  Mental health needs are increasing.  Violence against women and children is increasing.   I’d like to be — I’d like to be doing it with the support of Republicans.  I’ve met with Republicans.  There’s some really fine people who want to get something done, but they’re just not willing to go as far as  I’ve told both Republicans and Democrats that’s my preference: to work together.  But if  That’s why I’m so grateful to the House and Senate for moving so fast on the American Rescue Plan.  Here’s what’s in that plan:  First, it puts $160 billion into our national COVID-19 strategy, which includes more money for manufacturing, distribution, and setting up of vaccination sites — everything that’s needed to get vaccines into people’s arms.  There is simply nothing more important than us getting the resources we need to vaccinate the people in this country as soon, as quickly as possible.  So, job number one of the American Rescue Plan is vaccines.  Vaccines.  The second, the American Rescue Plan is going to keep the commitment of $2,000: $600 has already gone out; $1,400 checks to people who need it.  This is money directly in people’s pockets.  They need it.  We need to target that money.  So, folks making $300,000 don’t get any windfall.  But if you’re a two — if you’re a two — if you’re a family that’s a two-wage earner, each of the parents — one making 30 grand and one making 40 or 50 — maybe that’s a little more than — well, yeah, they need the money, and they’re going to get it.  And here’s what  And very quickly, here’s the rest of my plan:  It has money for food and nutrition so that folks don’t go hungry.   It helps small businesses, thousands of whom have had to go out of business.   It has money to help folks pay their health insurance.  It has rental assistance to keep people in their homes, rather than being thrown out in the street.  It’s got money to help us open our schools safely.  It has money for childcare, for paid leave.   It gets needed resources to state and local governments to prevent layoffs of essential personnel — firefighters, nurses, folks that are schoolteachers, sanitation workers.  It raises the minimum wage.   It’s big, and it’s bold.  And it’s a real answer to the crisis we’re in.   And it’s one more thing.  And  My plan creates more jobs, it creates more economic growth, and does more to make us competitive with the rest of the world than any other plan.  Don’t take my word for it.  Just look at what leading economists across the nation have said — and the world, and across the ocean have said.   Wall Street investment firm, Moody’s, says if we pass the American Rescue Plan, it will lead to 4 million more jobs than otherwise would be created.  The nonpartisan Brookings Institution has looked at the Rescue — American Rescue Plan and said the  Look, just this week, the Congressional Budget Office projected that if we don’t take action, it would take until the year 2025 to return to full employment.   There’s also a growing chorus of top economists — right, center, and left — that say we should be less focused on the deficit and more focused on the investments we make, and can make now, in jobs, keeping families out of poverty, and preventing long-term economic damage to our nation.  The simple truth is, if we make these investments now, with interest rates at historic lows, we’ll generate more growth, higher incomes, a stronger economy, and our nation’s finances will be in a stronger position as well.  And the payoff won’t just be in jobs but in our global competitiveness as well — because we’ll be regaining our economic strength faster.  So, the way  But it wasn’t enough.  It wasn’t quite big enough.  It stemmed the crisis, but the recovery could have been faster and even bigger.  Today, we need an answer that meets the challenge of this crisis, not one that falls short.  And that’s the issue facing the country right now.   What Republicans have proposed is either to do nothing or not enough.  All of a sudden, many of them have rediscovered fiscal restraint and the concern for the deficits.  But don’t kid yourself — this approach will come with a cost: more pain for more people, for longer than it has to be.  Secretary Yellen talks about the scarring effect that comes with prolonged economic pain.  We see that scarring effect in economic data.  But more important, we can see it in the lives of people living with long-term unemployment, living in hunger, at wits’ end over how to keep their jobs and take care of their kids.  And then she talks about the need to alleviate long-term suffering in the economy.  We can do that.  We don’t have to wait until 2025 to get back to full employment, which will be the case if we don’t do this.  Again, independent analysis from places like  Moody’s, on Wall Street, the Brookings Institution — the American Rescue Plan could achieve that by the beginning — full employment by the beginning of next year.  So, to me, this is — this is what this moment comes down to.  Are we going to pass a big enough package to vaccinate people, to get people back to work, to alleviate the suffering in this country this year?  That’s what   We do have the resources to get to full employment sooner.  We do have the tools to reduce a lot of suffering in this country.  We just have to choose to use them.  So it’s time to act.  We can reduce suffering in this country.  We can put people back to work.  We can control — gain control of this virus.  That’s what the American Rescue Plan does.  And that’s what I’m determined to do, and that’s what  So may God bless you all.  May God protect our troops.  And                                    10:04  And  Just look at all the number of people who are needing and seeking mental health services now.  Suicide is up.  People are very — really, really — drug abuse, violence against women.  People are really feeling the hole.  They don’t know how to get out.  You’ve given them a lot of hope — a lot of hope with the — as they say in southern Delaware: With the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbor, with the crick not rising, we can really begin to do something consequentially.  So  But again, the end result is, it’s not just the macroeconomic impact on the economy and our ability to compete internationally; it’s people’s lives.  Real, live people are hurting, and we can fix it.  And we can fix it.  And the irony of all ironies is, when we help them, we are also helping our competitive capacity through the remainder of this decade.   So we got a chance to do something big here.  And I’m — and thank you for last night, yesterday, and what you’re going to be doing on this Recovery Act.  And  So, thank you all for being here, and thank you for coming in.   10:07        Harry S. Truman Building Washington, D.C.  2:45 P.M.  Good afternoon, everyone.  It’s an honor to be back at the State Department under the eyes of the first American chief diplomat, Benjamin Franklin.    And, by the way,  Anyway, all kidding aside, it’s great to be here and stand alongside our most recent and senior diplomat, Secretary Tony Blinken.  Mr. Secretary, thank you for welcoming us today.  We’ve worked together for over 20 years. Your diplomatic skills are respected equally by your friends and our competitors around the world.  And they know when you speak, you speak for me.  And so — so is the message  As  We must meet the new moment accelerating glo- — accelerating global challenges — from the pandemic to the climate crisis to nuclear proliferation — challenging the will only to be solved by nations working together and in common.  We can’t do it alone.    That must be this — we must start with diplomacy rooted in America’s most cherished democratic values: defending freedom, championing opportunity, upholding universal rights, respecting the rule of law, and treating every person with dignity.  That’s the grounding wire of our global policy — our global power.  That’s our inexhaustible source of strength.  That’s America’s abiding advantage.  Though many of these values have come under intense pressure in recent years, even pushed to the brink in the last few weeks, the American people are going to emerge from this moment stronger, more determined, and better equipped to unite the world in fighting to defend democracy, because we have fought for it ourselves.  Over the past few days, we’ve been in close cooperation with our allies and partners to bring together the international community to address the military coup in Burma.  I’ve also been in touch with Leader McConnell to discuss our shared concerns about the situation in Burma, and we are united in our resolve.    There can be no doubt: In a democracy, force should never seek to overrule the will of the people or attempt to erase the outcome of a credible election.    The Burmese military should relinquish power they have seized, release the advocates and activists and officials they have detained, lift the restrictions on telecommunications, and refrain from violence.  As  Over the past two weeks, I’ve spoken with the leaders of many of our closest friends — Canada, Mexico, the UK, Germany, France, NATO, Japan, South Korea, Australia — to being [begin] reforming the habits of cooperation and rebuilding the muscle of democratic alliances that have atrophied over the past few years of neglect and,  America’s alliances are our greatest asset, and leading with diplomacy means standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies and key partners once again.  By leading with diplomacy, we must also mean engaging our adversaries and our competitors diplomatically, where it’s in our interest, and advance the security of the American people.  That’s why, yesterday, the United States and Russia agreed to extend the New  At the same time,  The politically motivated jailing of Alexei Navalny and the Russian efforts to suppress freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are a matter of deep concern to us and the international community.    Mr. Navalny, like all Russian citizens, is entitled to his rights under the Russian constitution.  He’s been targeted — targeted for exposing corruption.  He should be released immediately and without condition.  And we’ll also take on directly the challenges posed by our prosperity, security, and democratic values by our most serious competitor, China.    We’ll confront China’s economic abuses; counter its aggressive, coercive action; to push back on China’s attack on human rights, intellectual property, and global governance.  But we are ready to work with Beijing when it’s in America’s interest to do so.  We will compete from a position of strength by building back better at home, working with our allies and partners, renewing our role in international institutions, and reclaiming our credibility and moral authority, much of which has been lost.  That’s why we’ve moved quickly to begin restoring American engagement internationally and earn back our leadership position, to catalyze global action on shared challenges.  On day one,  America must lead in the face of this existential threat.  And just as with the pandemic, it requires global cooperation.    We’ve also reengaged with the World Health Organization.  That way, we can build better global preparedness to counter COVID-19, as well as detect and prevent future pandemics, because there will be more.    We’ve elevated the status of cyber issues within our government, including appointing the first national — Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology.  We’re launching an urgent initiative to improve our capability, readiness, and resilience in cyberspace.    Today, I’m announcing additional steps to course-correct our foreign policy and better unite our democratic values with our diplomatic leadership.    To begin, Defense Secretary Austin will be leading a Global Posture Review of our forces so that our military footprint is appropriately aligned with our foreign policy and national security priorities.  It will be coordinated across all elements of our national security, with Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken working in close cooperation.    And while this review is taking place, we’ll be stopping any planned troop withdrawals from Germany.  We’re also stepping up our diplomacy to end the war in Yemen — a war which has created a humanitarian and strategic catastrophe.  I’ve asked my Middle East team to ensure our support for the United Nations-led initiative to impose a ceasefire, open humanitarian channels, and restore long-dormant peace talks.   This morning, Secretary Blinken appointed Tim Lenderking, a career foreign policy officer, as our special envoy to the Yemen conflict.  And  And Tim’s diplomacy will be bolstered by USI- — USAID, working to ensure that humanitarian aid is reaching the Yemeni people who are suffering un- — an undurable [sic] — unendurable devastation.  This war has to end.    And to underscore our commitment, we are ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arms sales.    At the same time, Saudi Arabia faces missile attacks,  We also face a crisis of more than 80 million displaced people suffering all around the world.  The United States’ moral leadership on refugee issues was a point of bipartisan consensus for so many decades when  So today, I’m approving an executive order to begin the hard work of restoring our refugee admissions program to help meet the unprecedented global need.  It’s going to take time to rebuild what has been so badly damaged, but that’s precisely what we’re going to do.   This executive order will position us to be able to raise the refugee admissions back up to 125,000 persons for the first full fiscal year of the Biden-Harris administration.  And I’m directing the State Department to consult with Congress about making a down payment on that commitment as soon as possible.    And to further repair our moral leadership, I’m also issuing a presidential memo to agencies to reinvigorate our leadership on the  And finally, to successfully reassert our diplomacy and keep Americans safe, prosperous, and free, we must restore the health and morale of our foreign policy institutions.     So, with your help, the United States will again lead not just by the example of our power but the power of our example.    That’s why my administration has already taken the important step to live our domestic values at home — our democratic values at home.    Within hours of taking office,  And as part of our commitment to truth, transparency, and accountability, we stated on day one — we started on day one with daily briefings of the press from the White House.  We’ve reinstate- — we’ve reinstituted regular briefings here at State and at the Pentagon.  We believe a free press isn’t an adversary; rather, it’s essential.   We’ve restored our commitment to science and to create policies grounded in facts and evidence.   We’ve taken steps to acknowledge and address systemic racism and the scourge of white supremacy in our own country.  Racial equity will not just be an issue for one department in our administration, it has to be the business of the whole of government in all our federal policies and institutions.   All this matters to foreign policy, because when we host the Summit of Democracy early in my administration to rally the nations of the world to defend democracy globally, to push back the authoritarianism’s advance, we’ll be a much more credible partner because of these efforts to shore up our own foundations.   There’s no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy.  Every action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American working families in mind.  Advancing a foreign policy for the middle class demands urgent focus on our domestic econog- — economic renewal.  And that’s why  These investments are going to create jobs, maintain America’s competitive edge globally, and ensure all Americans share in the dividends.   If we invest in ourselves and our people, if we fight to ensure that American businesses are positioned to compete and win on the global stage, if the rules of international trade aren’t stacked against us, if our workers and intellectual property are protected, then there’s no country on Earth — not China or any other country on Earth — that can match us.  Investing in our diplomacy isn’t something we do just because it’s the right thing to do for the world.  We do it in order to live in peace, security, and prosperity.  We do it because it’s in our own naked self-interest.  When we strengthen our alliances, we amplify our power as well as our ability to disrupt threats before they can reach our shores.    When we invest in economic development of countries, we create new markets for our products and reduce the likelihood of instability, violence, and mass migrations.    When we strengthen health systems in far regions of the world, we reduce the risk of future pandemics that can threaten our people and our economy.    When we defend equal rights of people the world over — of women and girls,  America cannot afford to be absent any longer on the world stage.   For the diplomacy of Ben Franklin helped assure the success of our revolution.  The vision of the Marshall Plan helped prevent the world from foundering on the wreckage of war.  And the passions of Eleanor Roosevelt declared the audacious idea of universal rights that belong to all.  The leadership of diplomats of every stripe, doing the daily work of engagement, created the very idea of a free and interconnected world.  We are a country that does big things.  American diplomacy makes it happen.  And our administration is ready to take up the mantle and lead once again.    Thank you all.  And may God bless you and protect our troops, our diplomats, and our development experts, and all Americans serving in harm’s way.    Going this way.  Thank you all.    3:04 P.M.         5:25   You know, one of the things, when you are in a combat zone of the military or you’re a  But they put their lives on the line, and it’s a hell of a price to pay.  And every single day, every single one of these folks get up and they — by and large, the vast, vast majority of these men and women are decent, honorable people who put themselves on the line, and we owe them.   But the purpose of my asking you here today is  Today, I’m going to sign a few executive orders to strengthen our immigration system, building on the executive actions  And  This is about how America is safer, stronger, more prosperous when we have a fair, orderly, and humane, and legal immigration system.   And with the first action today, we’re going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration that literally, not figuratively, ripped children from the arms of their families — their mothers and fathers at the border — and with no plan, none whatsoever, to reunify the children who are still in custody and their parents.  The second action addresses the root causes of a migration to our southern border.   And the third action — the third order I’m going to be signing orders a full review of the previous administration’s harmful and counterproductive immigration policies, basically across the board.  And so, with that, I’m going to sign the first order, which is the reestablishment of an Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families.  It removes the stain on our reputation for what these separations caused.     That is the first order.   The second order I’m signing is “Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework to Address the Causes of Migration, [and] to Manage Migration Throughout the North and Central America, and to Provide [a] Safe and Orderly Processing Of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border”.    And the third order I’m signing is “Restoring [the] Faith in Our Legal Immigration System and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans.”    As my grandfather would say: By the grace of God and the goodwill of neighbors, we’ll reunite these children and reestablish our reputation as being a haven for people in need.   Thank you very, very much.       Thank you.     We’ll have plenty of time to talk about it.  5:31         1:43  It’s been a busy week, and I’ve signed executive orders tackling COVID-19, the economic and climate crises, as well as advancing racial equity.  But, today, I’m about to sign two executive orders that are — basically, the best way to describe them, to undo the damage Trump has done.  There’s nothing new that we’re doing here, other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring the Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became President, which by fiat he changed — made more inaccessible, more expensive, and more difficult for people to qualify for either of those two items: the Affordable Care Act or Medicaid.   And the second — the second order I’m going to be signing also changes what the President has done — the President — the President — what the former President has done.  And it — a memorandum reversed the — my predecessor’s attack on women’s health —  — excuse me — health access.  And as we continue to battle COVID-19, it’s even more critical that Americans have meaningful access to healthcare.    And so that’s what I’m about to do.  And again, I’m not initiating any new law, any new aspect of the law.  This is going back to what the situation was prior to the President’s executive orders.   And the first one I’m going to be signing here is to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.  And of all times that we need to reinstate access to, affordability of, and the extent of access to Medicaid is now, in the middle of this    And the second order I’m singing relates to protecting women’s health at home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made to Title 10 and other things, making it harder for women to have access to affordable healthcare as it relates to their reproductive rights.     I’m sorry you had to stand in the cold before you all came in.  Thank you all very much.     We got a lot to do.  And the first thing     No one requires me to do anything.  Thank you.  1:46         1:37 P.M.  And let me just start by saying,     And — but John has been deeply involved; the Secretary has been deeply involved in climate issues as a senator and one of the leaders, legislatively, as well.  And  And Gina — you run everything, Gina.  Thank you very much.   Let me get to it.  Today is “Climate Day” at the White House and — which means that today is “Jobs Day” at the White House.  We’re talking about American innovation, American products, American labor.  And we’re talking about the health of our families and cleaner water, cleaner air, and cleaner communities.  We’re talking about national security and America leading the world in a clean energy future.   It’s a future of enormous hope and opportunity.  It’s about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we — that’s now facing us — climate change — with a greater sense of urgency.  In my view, we’ve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis and we can’t wait any longer.  We see it with our own eyes, we feel it, we know it in our bones, and it’s time to act.   And  It’s — that’s why I’m signing today an executive order to supercharge our administration ambitious plan to confront the existential threat of climate change.  And it is an existential threat.   Last year, wildfires burned more than 5,000 acres in the West — as no one knows better than the Vice President, a former Senator from California — an area roughly the size of the entire state of New Jersey.  More intense and powerful hurricanes and tropical storms pummeled states across the Gulf Coast and along the East Coast —  And many climate and health calamities are colliding all at once.  It’s not just the pandemic that keeps people inside; it’s poor air quality.  Multiple studies have shown that air pollution is associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19.  And just like we need a unified national response to COVID-19, we desperately need a unified national response to the climate crisis because there is a climate crisis.   We must keep — we must lead global response because neither challenge can be met, as Secretary Kerry has pointed out many times, by the United States alone.  We know what to do, we’ve just got to do it.   When we think of climate change, we think of it — this is a case where conscious and convenience cross paths, where dealing with this existential threat to the planet and increasing our economic growth and prosperity are one in the same.  When   You know, we can put millions of Americans to work modernizing our water systems, transportation, our energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme climate.  We’ve already reached a point where we’re going to have to live with what it is now.  That’s going to require a lot of work all by itself, without it getting any worse.   When we think of renewable energy, we see American manufacturing, American workers racing to lead the global market.  We see farmers making American agriculture first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions and gaining new sources of income in the process.   And  We see small business and master electricians designing, installing, and innovating energy-conserving technologies and building homes and buildings.  And we’re going to reduce electric consumption and save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs in the process.   And when the previous administration reversed the Obama-Biden vehicle standard and picked Big Oil companies over American workers, the Biden-Harris administration will not only bring those standards back, we’ll set new, ambitious ones that our workers are ready to meet.   We see these workers building new buildings, installing 500,000 new electric vehicle charging stations across the country as we modernize our highway systems to adapt to the changes that have already taken place.  We see American consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and incentives, and the residents of our cities and towns  breathing cleaner air, and fewer kids living with asthma and dying from it.  And not only that, the federal government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles, as you all know.  With today’s executive order, combined with the Buy American executive order  the purchasing power of the federal government to buy clean,  zero-emission vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in America.  With everything  Already, 84 percent of all new electric capacity  planned to come onto the electric grid this is year is clean energy.  Clean energy.  Why?  Because it’s affordable;  because it’s clean; because, in many cases, it’s cheaper.  And it’s the way we’re keeping up — they’re keeping up.  We’re going to need scientists, the national labs, land-grant universities, historical black colleges and universities to innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit clean electric — clean electricity across distances, and battery technology, and a whole range of other things.  We need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them.  We need iron workers and welders to install them.  Technologies they invent, design, and build will ultimately become cheaper than any other kind of energy, helping us dramatically expand our economy and create more jobs with a cleaner, cleaner environment.  And we’ll become the world’s largest exporter of those technologies, creating even more jobs.   You know, we are also — we’re going to build 1.5 million  new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that are going to benefit communities three times over: one, by alleviating the affordable housing crisis; two, by increasing energy efficiency; and, three, by reducing the racial wealth gap  linked to home ownership.  We’re also going to create more than a quarter million jobs to do things like plug the millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that pose an ongoing threat to the health and safety of our communities.  They’re abandoned wells that are open now, and we’re going to put people to work.  They’re not going to lose jobs in these areas; they’re going to create jobs.  They’re going to get prevailing wage to cap those over a million wells.  These aren’t pie-in-the-sky dreams.  These are concrete,  actionable solutions, and we know how to do this.  The Obama-Biden administration reduced the auto industry — rescued the auto industry and helped them retool.  We need solar energy cost-competitive with traditional energy, weatherizing more — we made them cost-competitive, weatherizing more than a million homes.  The Recovery Act of our administration — the last admin- — our admin- — the Democratic administration made record clean energy investments: $90 billion.  The President asked me to make sure how that money was spent, on everything from smart grid systems to clean energy manufacturing.  Now, the Biden-Harris administration is going to do it again and go beyond.  The executive order I’ll be signing establishes a White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy.  And it’ll be led by one of America’s most distinguished climate leaders, former  This is not — it’s not time for small measures; we need to be bold.  So, let me be clear: That includes helping revitalize  the economies of coal, oil, and gas, and power plant communities.  We have to start by creating new, good-paying jobs, capping those abandoned wells, reclaiming mines, turning old brownfield sites into new hubs of economic growth, creating new, good-paying jobs in those communities where those workers live because they helped build this country.  We’re never going to forget the men and women who dug the coal and built the nation.  We’re going to do right by them   and make sure they have opportunities to keep building the nation and their own communities and getting paid well for it.  While the whole-of-government approach is necessary, though, it’s not sufficient.  We’re going to work with mayors and governors and tribal leaders and business leaders who are stepping up, and the young people organizing and leading the way.  My message to those young people is: You have the full capacity and power of the federal government.  Your government is going to work with you.   Now, today’s executive order also directs the Secretary of the Interior to stop issuing new oil and gas leases on public lands and offsh- — and offshore waters, wherever possible.  We’re going to review and reset the oil and gas leasing program.   Like the previous administration, we’ll start to properly manage — unlike it, we’re going to start to properly manage lands and waterways in ways that allow us to protect, preserve them — the full value that they provide for us for future generations.   Let me be clear, and  Unlike previous administrations,  We’re going to take money and invest it in clean energy jobs in America — millions of jobs in wind, solar, and carbon capture.  In fact, today’s actions are going to help us increase renewable energy production from offshore wind and meet our obligation to be good stewards of our public lands.   It establishes a new, modern-day Civilian Climate Corps — that  Look, this executive order I’m signing today also makes it official that climate change will be at the center of our national security and foreign policy.   As Secretary Kerry — as our Special Presidential Envoy for Climate — with him, the world knows how serious  And today’s executive order will help strengthen that commitment by working with other nations to support the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change and to increase our collective resilience.  That includes a summit of world leaders that I’ll convene to address this climate crisis on Earth Day, this year.  In order to establish a new effort to integrate the security implications of climate change as part of our national security and risk assessment and analysis will also be included.  With this executive order, environmental justice will be at the center of all we do addressing the disproportionate health and environmental and economic impacts on communities of color — so-called “fenceline communities” — especially those communities — brown, black, Native American, poor whites.  It’s hard — the hard-hit areas like Cancer Alley in Louisia- — Cancer Alley in Louisiana, or the Route 9 corridor in the state of Delaware.   That’s why we’re going to work to make sure that they receive 40 percent of the benefits of key federal investments in clean energy, clean water, and wastewater infrastructure.  Lifting up these communities makes us all stronger as a nation and increases the health of everybody.  Finally, as with our fight against COVID-19, we will listen to the science and protect the integrity of our federal response to the climate crisis.  Earlier this month,  It’s a team of America’s top scientists charged with asking the most American of questions: “What next?  What’s the next big breakthrough?”  And then helping us make the impossible possible.   Today, I’m signing a presidential memorandum making it clear that we will protect our world-class scientists from political interference and ensure they can think, research, and speak freely and directly to me, the Vice President, and the American people.  To summarize, this executive order — it’s about jobs — good-paying union jobs.  It’s about workers building our economy back better than before.  It’s a whole-of-government approach to put climate change at the center of our domestic, national security, and foreign policy.  It’s advancing conservation; revitalizing communities and cities and in the fa– on the farmlands; and securing environmental justice.  Our plans are ambitious, but we are America.  We’re bold.  We are unwavering in the pursuit of jobs and innovation, science and discovery.  We can do this, we must do this, and we will do this.  I’m now going to sign the executive order to meet the climate crisis with American jobs and American ingenuity.  And  The first order I’m signing is tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad.    This next one: Restoring trust in government through science and integrity and evidence-based policy making.  .  One more here.  And this last one is the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology established.  .                                     4:50 P.M. And so, This will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we’ve ever undertaken as a nation.  I’ve said that before, but And so, I’ve — as I’ve said in the past, we want to give credit to everyone involved in this vaccine effort and the prior administration and the science community and the medical sphere —  — for getting the program — But it’s also no secret that we have recently discovered, in the final days of the transition — and it wasn’t until the final days we got the kind of cooperation we needed — that once we arrived, the vaccine program is worse shape than we anticipated or expected.  Even before I’m pleased to announce the first progress in that work today on day seven of my presidency.  First, after review of the current vaccine supply manufacturing plants, And you all know — if The second thing: We’re increasing the transparency with states, cities, and tribes, and local partners when it comes to the vaccine supply.  This is something we’ve heard over and over again from both Democrats and Republicans, state and local leaders: that they need a plan in order to what — they didn’t know what they had to plan on.  They need to know what the order is going to be.   Jeff had a meeting with the governors on Zoom and — and others.  And But until now, we’ve had to guess how much vaccine to expect for the next week.  And that’s what the governors had to do: “How much am From this week forward, God willing, we’ll ensure that states, tribes, and territories will now always have a reliable three-week forecast on what the supply they’re going to get.  So they’ll know, three weeks ahead of time, what’s going to be there in the third week.   This is going to help make sure governors, mayors, and local leaders have greater certainty around supply so they can carry out their plans to vaccinate as many people as possible.  So, we will both increase the supply in the short term by more than 15 percent and give our states and local partners more certainty about when the deliveries will arrive.  These two steps are going to help increase our prospects of hitting and — or exceeding, God willing, the ambitious goal of 100 million shots in 100 days.   But Now, that means fewer than 100 million people getting totally vaccinated; it means 100 [million] shots, and it means somewhere between 60 — maybe less, maybe more — million people will have the — because it requires two shots in many cases — not always.  So today, I’m directing COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zeints, here, to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to increase our total supply of vaccine for the American people.  And we believe that we’ll soon be able to confirm the purchase of an additional 100 billion [million] doses for each of the two FDA-authorized vaccines: Pfizer and Moderna.  That’s 100 million more doses of Pfizer and 100 million more doses of Moderna — 200 million more doses than the federal government had previously secured.  Not in hand yet, but ordered.   We expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer.  And some of it will come as early — begin to come in early summer, but by the mid- — by the mid-summer, that this vaccine will be there.  And the order — and that increases the total vaccine order in the United States by 50 percent — from 400 million ordered to 600 million.   This is enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 Americans by the end of the summer, beginning of the fall.  But we want to make — look, that’s — I’ve said before: This is a wartime effort.  When And as such, We’re going to be working across the government, with private industry, to ramp up production of vaccine and protective equipment — the syringes, the needles, the gloves, the swabs, and the masks — everything that’s needed to protect, test, vaccinate, and take care of our people.  Well, we’ve already identified suppliers, and we’re working with them to move our plan forward.   The biggest problem — These aggressive steps to increase vaccine supply come on top of the steps we took last week to get more people vaccinated for free, to create more places for them to get vaccinated, and to mobilize more medical teams to get shots in people’s arms.  We’ve directed FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to stand up the first federally supported community vaccination centers, and that work is underway.  We’re working to make vaccines available to thousands of local pharmacies, beginning in early February; it’s a couple weeks off.  And we — that will enormously expand our reach.  Last week, We’re also expanding testing, which will help schools and businesses reopen safely and protect the most vulnerable.  And we formalized the Health Equity Task Force to ensure that equity is at the core of everything we do in urban and rural communities alike, to make sure those people most significantly damaged have — have access.  Access.  We have to change.  We have move in a direction for those communities that are hard to get to.  But the brutal truth is: It’s going to take months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated.  Months.  In the next few months, masks — not vaccines — are the best defense against COVID-19.  Experts say that wearing masks from now just until April would save 50,000 lives who otherwise will pass away if we don’t wear these masks.  That’s why I’m asking the American people to mask up for the first 100 days.  I’ve issued executive orders requiring masks on federal property and interstate travel — trains and planes and buses.       One congressman pointed out — You’ve all hold — if you could hold a second — you’ve all heard about the strain — the British strain, the Brazilian strain, the South African strain.  And they are — they seem to be more transmittable more easily.  So, in addition to wearing masks, everyone flying to the United States from another country, we need to test before they get on that plane and self-quarantine when they arrive in America.  I’m going to close with this: economic relief to Americans who are badly in need of it through no fault of their own.   And our plan will take time.  Progress from our plan will take time to measure, as people getting infected today don’t show up in case counts for weeks, and those who perish from those — from the disease die weeks after that exposure.  You know, despite the best — our best intentions, we’re going to face setbacks, which And let me be clear: Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better.  The death toll, experts tell us, is likely to top 500,000 by the end of next month — February — and cases will continue to mount.  We didn’t get into this mess overnight, and it’s going to take months for us to turn things around.  But let me be equally clear: We’re going to get through this.  We will defeat this pandemic.   And to a nation waiting for action, let me be clearest on this point: Help is on the way.  We can do this if we come together, if we listen to the scientists.  And as So, thank you very much for your patience.  Keep the faith.  We’re going to get this done.  And I’ll always level with you about the state of affairs.   Thank you.                                    2:06 P.M.      or had simply refused to see, couldn’t be ignored any longer.  Those 8 minutes and 46 seconds that took George Floyd’s life opened the eyes of millions of Americans and millions of people around — all over the world.  It was the knee on the neck of justice, and it wouldn’t be forgotten.  It stirred the conscience of tens of millions of Americans, and, in my view, it marked a turning point in this country’s attitude toward racial justice.   When his six-years-old — six-year-old daughter, Gianna, who COVID-19 has further ripped a path of destruction through every community in America, but no one has been spared, but the devastation in communities of color has been nothing short of stunning.  Just look at the numbers: 40 percent of frontline workers — nurses, first responders, grocery store workers — are Americans of color, and many are still living on the edge.  One in ten black Americans is out of work today.  One in eleven Latino Americans is out of work today.  One in seven households in America — about one in four black, one in five Latino households in America — report that they don’t have enough food to eat in the United States of America.   Black and Latino Americans are dying of COVID-19 at rates nearly three times that of white Americans.  And it’s not white Americans’ fault, but it’s just a fact.  And the Americans now know it, especially younger Americans.   One of the reasons I’m so optimistic about this nation is that today’s generation of young Americans is the most progressive, thoughtful, inclusive generation that America has ever seen.  And they are pulling us toward justice in so many ways, forcing us to confront the huge gap in economi- — excuse me, economic inequity between those at the top and everyone else, forcing us to confront the existential crisis of climate; and, yes, forcing us to confront systemic racism and white supremacy.   It’s just been weeks since all of America witnessed a group of thugs, insurrectionists, political extremists, and white supremacists violently attack the Capitol of our democracy.  And so now — now is the time to act.  It’s time to act because that’s what the faith and morality calls us to do.  Across nearly every faith, the same principles hold: We’re all God’s children; we should treat each other as we would like to be treated ourselves.  And this is time to act — and this time to act is because it’s what the core values of this nation call us to do.  And We have never fully lived up to the founding principles of this nation, to state the obvious, that all people are created equal and have a right to be treated equally throughout their lives.  And it’s time to act now, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because if we do, we’ll all be better off for it.  For too long, we’ve allowed a narrow, cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester.  You know, we’ve — we’ve bought the view that America is a zero-sum game in many cases: “If you succeed, We’ve lost sight of what President Kennedy told us when he said, “Just imagine if instead of consigning millions of American children to under-resourced schools, we gave each and every three- and four-year-old child a chance to learn, to go to school — not daycare, school — and grow and thrive in school and throughout.  When they’ve done that — the places it’s been done, it shows they have an exponentially greater chance of going all the way through 12 years of school and doing it well.  But, you know, does anyone — does anyone in this whole nation think we’re not all better off if that were to happen?   Just imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own a home and build generational wealth — who made it possible for them buy a home, their first home — and begin to build equity to provide for their families and send their children off to school, does anyone doubt that the whole nation will be better off?   Just imagine: Instead of denying millions of young entrepreneurs the ability to access capital, we made it possible to take their dream to market, create jobs, reinvest in their own communities.  Does anyone doubt this whole nation wouldn’t be better off?  Just imagine if more incredibly creative and innovative — how much more creative and innovative we’d be if this nation held — held the historic black colleges and universities to the same opportunities — and minority-serving institutions — that had the same funding and resources of public universities to compete for jobs and industries of the future.  You know, just ask the first But to do this, That’s why And I’ve asked Ambassador Susan Rice to lead the administration’s charge through the White House and Domestic Policy Council because Today, I’ll be shortly signing an additional package of executive actions to continue this vital work.  Housing, for example: Housing is a right in America, and homeownership is an essential tool to wealth creation and to be passed down to generations.   Today, I’m directing the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs — and Urban Development to redress historical racism in federal housing policies.  Today, I’m directing the federal agency to reinvigorate the consultation process with Indian tribes.  Respect the tribal sovereignty — respect for tribal sovereignty will be a cornerstone of our engaging with Native American communities.   This builds on the work we did last week to expand tribes’ access to the Strategic National Stockpile for the first time, to ensure they receive help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to fight this pandemic.   Today, I’m directing federal agencies to combat resurgence of xenophobia, particularly against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, that we’ve seen skyrocket during this pandemic.  This is unacceptable and it’s un-American.  I’ve asked the Department of Justice to strengthen its partnership with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community to prevent those hate crimes.  I’ve also asked the Department of Health and Human Services to put out best practices for combatting xenophobia in our national response to COVID.  Look, in the weeks ahead, I’ll be reaffirming the federal government’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and accessibility, building on the work we started in the Obama-Biden administration.  That’s why Today, I’m also issuing an executive order that will ultimately end the Justice Department’s use of the private prison indus- — private prisons, an industry that houses pretrial detrainees [sic] — detainees and federal prisoners.   The executive order directs the Attorney General to decline to renew contracts with privately operated criminal facilities — a step we started to take at the end of the Obama administration and was reversed under the previous administration.  This is the first step to stop corporations from profiteering off of incarcerating — incarceration that is less humane and less safe, as the studies show.  And it is just the beginning of my administration’s plan to address systemic problems in our criminal justice system.  Here’s another thing that we need to do: We need to restore and expand the Voting Rights Act — named after our dear friend, John Lewis — and continue to fight back against laws that many states are engaged in to suppress the right to vote, while expanding access to the ballot box for all eligible voters.  Because here’s the deal, and I’ll close with this: But it’s corrosive, it’s destructive, and it’s costly.  It costs every American, not just who have felt the sting of racial injustice.  We aren’t just less of a — we are not just a nation of morally deprived because of systemic racism; we’re also less prosperous, we’re less successful, we’re less secure.   So, we must change, and Now I’m going to sign these executive actions to continue the work to make real the promise of America for every American.  Again, I’m not promising we can end it tomorrow, but Thank you.  This first executive order is a memorandum for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to redress our nation’s and the federal government’s history of discriminatory housing practices and policies.    The next executive order is reforming the incarceration system by eliminating the use of privately operated criminal detention facilities.    The third executive order is a memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies on tribal consultation, and strengthening nation-to-nation relationships.    The last executive order is condemning and combatting racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States.      You.    He sent his best.                                    3:42 P.M.      Last week, we immediately got to work to contain the pandemic and deliver economic relief to millions of Americans who need it the most.  And today we’re getting to work to rebuild the backbone of America: manufacturing, unions, and the middle class.   It’s based on a simple premise: that we’ll reward work, not wealth, in this country.  And the key plank of ensuring the future will be “Made in America.”  I’ve long said that For example, the federal government every year spends approximately $600 billion in government procurement to keep the country going safe and secure.  And there’s a law that’s been on the books for almost a century now: to make sure that that money was spent — taxpayers’ dollars for procurement is spent to support American jobs and American businesses.  But the previous administration didn’t take it seriously enough.  Federal agencies waived the Buy American requirement without much pushback at all.  Big corporations and special interests have long fought for loopholes to redirect American taxpayers’ dollars to foreign companies where the products are being made.  The result: tens of billions of American taxpayers’ dollars supporting foreign jobs and foreign industries.  In 1918 — excuse me, in 2018 alone, the Department spent $3 billion — the Defense Department — on foreign construction contracts, leaving American steel and iron out in the cold.  It spent nearly $300 million in foreign engines and on vehicles instead of buying American vehicles and engines from American companies, putting Americans to work.  Under the previous administration, the federal government contract awarded directly to foreign companies went up 30 percent.  That is going to change on our watch.   Today I’m taking the first steps in my larger Build Back Better Recovery Plan that invests in American workers, unions, and businesses up and down the supply chain.  And I’ll be signing an executive order in just a moment, tightening the existing Buy American policies, and go further.  We’re setting clear directives and clear explanations.  We’re going to get to the core issue with a centralized, coordinated effort.  Look, today I’m creating a director of Made in America at the White House Office of Management and Budget who will oversee our all-of-government Made in America initiative.  That starts with stopping federal agencies from waiving Buy American requirements with impunity, as has been going on.  If an agency wants to issue a waiver to say “We’re not going to buy an American product as part of this project; we’re going to buy a foreign product,” they have to come to the White House and explain it to us.   We’re going to require that waivers be publicly posted; that is, if someone is seeking a waiver to build this particular vehicle or facility and is going to buy the following foreign parts, that waiver — the request for it — is going to be posted.  Then we’ll work with small American manufacturers and businesses to give them a shot to raise their hand and say, “Yeah, It’s about — as you’ve heard me say before, And I’m directing the Office of Management and Budget to review waivers to make sure they are only used in very limited circumstances.  For example, when there’s an overwhelming national security, humanitarian, or emergency need here in America.  This hasn’t happened before. It will happen now.  Here’s what else we’re going to be doing.  Under the Build Back Better Recovery Plan, we’ll invest hundreds of billions of dollars in buying American products and materials to modernize our infrastructure, and our competitive strength will increase in a competitive world.  That means millions of good-paying jobs, using American-made steel and technology, to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our ports, and to make them more climate resilient, as well as making them able to move faster and cheaper and cleaner to transport American-made goods across the country and around the world, making us more competitive. It also means replenishing our stockpiles to enhance our national security.  As this pandemic has made clear, we can never again be in a position where we have to rely on a foreign country that doesn’t share our interest in order to protect our people during a national emergency.  We need to make our own protective equipment, essential products and supplies.  And we’ll work with our allies to make sure they have resilient supply chains as well.  We’ll also make historic investments in research and development — hundreds of billions of dollars — to sharpen America’s innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs — markets like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy.  The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we’re going to replace with clean, electric vehicles made right here in America by American workers, creating millions of jobs — a million autoworker jobs in clean energy — and vehicles that are net-zero emissions. And together, this will be the largest mobilization of public investment in procurement, infrastructure, and R&And with the executive order I’ll be signing today, we’ll increase Buy American requirements for these kinds of projects and improve the way we measure domestic content requirements.  For example, right now, if you manufacture a vehicle for the federal government, you need to show that at least 50 percent of the components of that vehicle were made in America.  But because of loopholes that have been expanded over time, you can count the least valuable possible parts as part of that 50 percent to say “Made in America,” while the most valuable parts — the engines, the steel, the glass, the manufac- — are manufactured abroad.  So basically — but basically we’re batting zero for two.  The content threshold of 50 percent aren’t high enough.  And the way we measure the content doesn’t account for U.S. jobs and economic activity.  We’re going to change that as well. The executive action I’m signing today will not only require that companies make more of their components in America, but that the value of those components is contributing to our economy, measured by things like a number of American jobs created and/or supported.  At the same time, we’ll be committed to working with our trading partners to modernize international trade rules, including those relating to government procurement, to make sure we can use — we can all use our taxpayer dollars to spur investment that promotes growth and resilient supply chains. And here’s what else the action does.  When we buy America, we’ll buy from all of America.  That includes communities that have historically been left out of government procurement — black, brown, Native American small businesses and entrepreneurs in every region of the country.  We will use a national network of manufacturers — called a Manufacturing Extension Partnership — that’s in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, to help government agency connect with new domestic suppliers across the country.  This is a critical piece of building our economy back better and including everyone in the deal this time, especially small businesses that are badly hurting in this economy.  The executive action I’ll close with this: The reason we need to do this is America can’t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. Our competitors aren’t waiting.  To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today, but the jobs and industries of tomorrow.  And we know that the middle class built this country, and we also know unions built the middle class.  So let’s invest in them once again.  Given even just half a chance, the American people, the American worker, has never, ever let the country down.  Imagine if we give them a full chance.  That’s what we’re going to do.  I’ll stop here and sign the executive order, and then come back and take some of your questions.       This executive order is entitled “Ensuring the Future Is Made in America, by Americans — All of American Workers.”  .  There you go.  Now I’d now be happy to take your questions.    For example, there is no reason why the clear guidance will be that every school should be thoroughly sanitized, from the lavatories to the hallways.  And so this is about making — and none of the school districts that I’m aware of — there may be some, of public school districts — have insisted that all of those pieces be in place.  And, So it’s not so much about the idea that teachers aren’t going to work.  The teachers And it’ll have the added advantage,     Well, look, the decision on reconciliation will be one made by the leaders of the House and the Senate.  But here’s the deal: You know, we — we didn’t have any votes for the recovery package when Barack and And — but here’s the deal: You know, it’s interesting — and The decision to use reconciliation will depend upon how these negotiations go.  And let me make clear about negotiations: I’ve always believed part of negotiation — on the part of a President and/or a chairman of a committee trying to get a major piece of legislation passed — is about consultation.   It’s not enough for me just to come up to you and say, “And   Hi, Annie.   So, given that it is such a key part of your message and your promise, can you talk and reflect a little bit more about what is unity when you see it and as you define it?    Well, Annie, Unity also is: trying to reflect what the majority of the American people — Democrat, Republican, and independent — think is within the fulcrum of what needs to be done to make their lives and the lives of Americans better.  For example, if you look at the data — and I’m not claiming the polling data to be exact, but if you look at the data, you have — Unity also is trying to get, at a minimum — if you pass a piece of legislation that breaks down on party lines but it gets passed, it doesn’t mean there wasn’t unity; it just means it wasn’t bipartisan.  I’d prefer these things to be bipartisan, because I’m trying to generate some consensus and take sort of the — how can There’s just — there’s easy ways to deal with this.  One, if you’re anti-union, you can say it’s all because of teachers.  If you want to make a case though that it’s complicated, you say, “Well, what do you have to do to make it safe to get in those schools?”  And we’re going to have arguments.  For example, you know The other piece of this is that the one thing that gives me hope that we’re not only going to, sort of, stay away from the ad hominem attacks on one another, is that there is an overwhelming consensus among the major economists at home and in the world that the way to avoid a deeper, deeper, deeper recession, moving in the direction of losing our competitive capacity, is to spend money now to — from — from across the board, every major institution has said, “If we don’t invest now, we’re going to lose so much altitude, in terms of our employment base and our economic growth, it’s going to be harder to reestablish it.”  We can afford to do it now.  As a matter of fact, the — And We have to work our way through because, as I’ve said 100 times, there is no ability in a democracy for it to function without the ability to reach consensus.  Other- — otherwise it just becomes executive fiat or battleground issues that are — get us virtually nowhere.    — on almost any issue.  Well, that benefits no one.  It doesn’t inform anybody.  It doesn’t allow the public to make judgments about who they think is right or wrong.  So   Josh, they don’t trust you with the mic, huh?  You mentioned just now that you might know in a couple of weeks.  Can And might   Well, I’ll try to answer the three parts to your question as One, time is of the essence.  Time is of the essence.  And Number two, we are optimistic that we will have enough vaccine and in very short order.  We, as you know, we came in office without knowledge of how much vaccine was held — being held in abeyance or available.  Now that we’re here — we’ve been around a week or so — we now have that.  And we’ve gotten commitments from some of the producers that they will, in fact, produce more vaccine in a relatively short period of time and then continue that down the road.  So I’m quite confident that we will be in a position, within the next three weeks or so, to be vaccinating people at the range of a million a day or in excess of that.  That is my — And everything points that we’re going to have: A, the — enough vaccine; B, enough syringes and all the paraphernalia needed to store, keep, inject, move into your arm the vaccine; three, a number of vaccinators, people administering the vaccine, which is not an easy task of those who have — those facilities, like the nursing homes and hospitals — they have people do it, but they don’t have the capacity to do everyone.  And so And thirdly, it’s really important that we have the fora, the place, the facility, the circumstance where people can show up, stand in line, and get their vaccine without having to stand in line for eight hours — being able to pick up the phone, call the pharmacy, and get your name on the list, et cetera.   All those mechanical things are really — they sound simple, but they’re all consequential when we’re trying to get out a minimum of 100 million vaccinations in 100 days and move in the direction where we are well beyond that in the next 100 days so we can get to the point where we reach herd immunity in a country of over 300 million people.  Did that answer your question?    Oh, But   Now, wait, wait, wait.    No,   Well, I’m going to shut down the virus, but not — We’re just, for the first day, It’s going to take time.  It’s going to take a heck of a lot of time.  And we still have — as Dr. Fauci constantly points out, it’s one thing when we have mass — how can We see — the first thing that happens is we see the number of infections go up.  Then you see the hospitalizations go up.  Then you see the deaths go up.  And so we’re in this for a while.  So — and again, remember: The vaccine — most of the people taking the vaccine — a vast, significant number — required two shots, and they’re an average of three weeks apart.  And it takes time for it to be sure that you’re — you get to that 95 percent assurance rate.   And so it’s beginning to move.  But I’m confident we will beat this.  We will beat this.  But we’re still going to be talking about this in the summer.  We’re still going to be dealing with this issue in the — in early fall.  And last point I’ll make — and Thank you so very much.                                           12:18 P.M.  But all kidding aside, this is reinstating a position that previous commanders and — as well as the Secretaries have supported.  And what I’m doing is enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform, and essentially restoring the situation as it existed before, with transgender personnel, if qualified in every other way, can serve their government in the United States military.  So that’s what I’m about to sign.  And I’m going to get a chance, I’m told, a little later on another matter — later this afternoon when  Thank you, again.      All right.  Thank you.    12:20 P.M.         3:04 P.M.  Yesterday, we learned that 900,000 more Americans filed for unemployment — 900,000.  They join millions of Americans who, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck.  So many of them never thought they’d ever be out of work in the first place.  And just like my dad did when he was — he used to lie awake at night when  And now, a lot of these folks are facing eviction, or waiting hours in their cars — literally hours in their cars, waiting to be able to feed their children as they drive up to a food bank.  It’s the United States of America and they’re waiting to feed their kids.  Folks who are able to still keep their job, many have seen their paychecks reduced, and they’ve — and they’re barely hanging on, and wondering what’s next.  Sometimes the anxiety about what’s going to happen next is more consequential than what actually happened.   But this is happening today, in America, and this cannot be who we are as a country.  These are not the values of our nation.  We cannot, will not let people go hungry.  We cannot let people be evicted because of nothing they did themselves.  They cannot watch people lose their jobs.  And we have to act.  We have to act now.   It’s not just to meet the moral obligation to treat our fellow Americans with the dignity and respect they deserve; this is an economic imperative.   There’s a growing chorus of top economic — top economists that agree that in this moment of crisis, with this — with the interest rates as low as they are — historic lows — it is smart fiscal investment, including deficit spending.  And they’re more urgent than ever.  You know, and that return on these investments and jobs and racial equity is going to prevent long-term economic damage and benefits that are going to far surpass the cost.  If we don’t act, the rest of the world is not standing still, in terms of the competitive advantage and the competitive possibilities, relative to us.   That our debt situation will be more stable and not less stable, according to these economists.  And that such investments in our people is going to strengthen our economic competitiveness as a nation and help us outcompete our competitors in the global economy, because we’re going to grow the economy with these investments.  While the COVID-19 package that passed in December was a first step, as  Last week,  You know, in just a few days — it’s just been a few days since  In fact, in a — an analysis by Moody’s estimates that if we passed our America Rescue Plan, the economy would create 7.5 million jobs just in this year alone.  That would be on the way to the more than 18 million —  And with our America Rescue Plan, our economy would return to full employment a full year faster than without the plan.   Even President Trump’s — President Trump’s now — not some liberal organization — Presidents Trump’s top former economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said, quote, he “absolutely is in favor” of this rescue plan.  This almost doesn’t have a partisan piece to it.   We’re seeing the support because this plan takes a step that we so urgently need.  More than just a step, a number of steps.   It funds big parts of the COVID-19 National Strategy that   The American Rescue Plan also includes economic relief for most Americans who are in need.  We’re going to finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in direct payments to folks.  Six hundred dollars, which was already passed, is simply not enough if you still have to choose between paying your rent and putting food on the table.  We’ll extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of workers, beyond the deadline that is now set.  It means that 16 million Americans who are currently relying on unemployment benefits while they look for work can count on these checks continuing to be there in the middle of this crisis.   The American Rescue Plan also addresses the growing housing crisis in America.  Approximately 14 million Americans — 14 million — have fallen behind on rent, and many risk eviction.  If we fail to act, there’ll be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months as this pandemic rages on, because there’s nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months.  So, look, this would overwhelm emergency shelters and increase COVID-19 infections as people have nowhere to go and are socially — can’t socially distance.  The American Rescue Plan asks Congress to provide rental assistance for millions of hard-hit families and tenants.  This will also be a bridge to economic recovery for countless mom-and-pop landlords who can’t afford not to have the rent.  But they can’t wait.  So, on Inauguration Day,  Police officers, firefighters, first responders, nurses are all at the risk of losing their jobs.  Over the last year, more than 600,000 educators have lost their jobs in the cities and towns.  The American Rescue Plan will provide emergency funding to keep these essential workers on the job and maintain essential services.  Look, it will also help small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth.  When you say “small business,” most people think the major corporate entities are the ones that hire everybody.  These small businesses are the glue that hold — and they’re important — but these small businesses hold the community — are the glue that hold these communities together.  They are hurting badly, and they account for nearly half of the entire U.S. workforce.  Nearly half.  Our rescue plan will provide flexible grants to help the hardest-hit small businesses survive the pandemic and low-cost capital to help entrepreneurs of all backgrounds create and maintain jobs, plus provide essential goods and services that communities so desperately depend on.  Look, our recovery plan also calls for an increase in the minimum wage, at 15 — at least $15.00 an hour.  No one in America should work 40 hours a week making below the poverty line.  Fifteen dollars gets people above the poverty line.  We have so many millions of people working 40 hours a week — working — and some with two jobs, and they’re still below the poverty line.  Our plan includes access to affordable childcare that’s going to enable parents, particularly women, to get back to work — millions who are not working now because they don’t have that care.  All told, the American Rescue Plan would lift  12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half.  That’s 5 million children lifted out of poverty.  Our plan would reduce poverty in the black community by one third and reduce poverty in the Hispanic community by almost 40 percent.   It’s a plan that will make historic investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy, and so much more that’s going to create millions more jobs — good-paying jobs, not minimum wage jobs.  But while we work with members of both parties in the Congress, there are steps that we can and must take right now.  For example, on Inauguration Day,  Today, I’m signing an executive order that directs the whole-of-government — a whole-of-government effort to help millions of Americans who are badly hurting.  It requires all federal agencies to do what they can do to provide relief to families, small businesses, and communities.  And in the days ahead,  Let me touch on two ways these actions can help change Americans lives.  We need to tackle the growing hunger crisis in America.  One in seven households in America — one in seven — more than one in five black and Latino households in America report they do not have enough food to eat.  That includes nearly 30 million adults and as many as 12 million children.  And again, they’re in a spec- — in this situation through no fault of their own.  It’s unconscionable.  The American Rescue Plan provides additional emergency food and nutrition assistance for tens of millions of children and families to address this crisis.  But families literally can’t wait another day.  As a result of the executive order I’m going to shortly sign, the Department of Agriculture will consider taking immediate steps to make it easier for the hardest-hit families to enroll and claim more generous benefits in the critical food and nutrition assistance area.  This is going to help tens of millions of families, especially those who can’t provide meals for their kids, who are learning remotely at home, are not receiving the regular meal plans that they’d have at school for breakfast or lunch.  It’s going to also — and we also need to protect the health and safety of the American worker.  Right now, approximately 40 percent of households in America have at least one member with a preexisting condition.  Just imagine: You’re out of work through no fault of your own.  You file for unemployment while you’re looking for a job.  You find one, and you get an offer.  But then you find out there’s a high risk of you getting infected with COVID-19 because of your condition.  You and your loved one — and you and your loved ones have ever even greater risk of death and serious illness because of the preexisting conditions, so you turn it down.  Right now, if you did that, you could be denied unemployment insurance because you’re offered a job and you didn’t take it.  It’s wrong.  No one should have to choose between their livelihoods and their own health or the health of their loved ones in the middle of a deadly pandemic.  Because of the executive order I’m about to sign,  Look, there are just two consequential ways that the action I’m taking today will help people in need.  Another — another way to help approximately 2 million veterans maintain their financial footing: by pausing federal collections on overpayments and debts.  Another makes sure that federal contractors are receiving taxpayer dollars, provide their workers with the pay and benefits they deserve.  These are places where federal tax dollars are administered — are being made available to build things from ships to staircases.  And we let out — the federal government lets the contract — and we’re going to make sure that they buy American and are made in America.   And here’s another: Right now, there are up to 8 million people that are eligible for direct payments from the  Look, I’m going to close and summarize this way:  If — if we act now, our economy will be stronger in both the short and long run.  That’s what economists — left, right, and center — are telling us, both liberal and conservative.  We’ll be better and stronger across the board.  If we act now, we’ll be better able to compete with the world.  If we act now, we’ll be better able to meet our moral obligations to one another as Americans.    The bottom line is this: We’re in a national emergency, and we need to act like we’re in a national emergency.  So we’ve got to move with everything we’ve got, and we’ve got to do it together.   And we have the tools to fix it.  We have the tools to get through this.  We have the tools to get this virus under control and our economy back on track.  And we have the tools to help people.  So let’s use the tools, all of them.  Use them now.   So I’m going to sign this executive order, but let me conclude again by saying: Folks, this is one of the cases where business, labor, Wall Street, Main Street, liberal, conservative, economists know we have to act now, not only to help who are in need now, but to allow us to be in the competitive position worldwide and be the leader of the world economy in the next year, and two, and three, and going forward.   So, thank you.  I’m going to sign this executive order.  The first one is the economic relief related to COVID-19 pandemic.    The second one is protection — protecting the federal workforce.    Thank you very much.      3:24 P.M.         11:52   Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans.  This is America’s day.  This is democracy’s day.   Of renewal and resolve.  Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge.  Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy.  The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.  We have learned again that democracy is precious.  Democracy is fragile.  And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.  So now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol’s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.  We look ahead in our uniquely American way – restless, bold, optimistic – and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be.    You know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation.  As does President Carter, who   But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us.  On “We the People” who seek a more perfect Union.  This is a great nation and we are a good people.  Over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go.  We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility.  Much to repair.  Much to restore.  Much to heal.  Much to build.  And much to gain.  Few periods in our nation’s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we’re in now.   It’s taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II.  Millions of jobs have been lost.  Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed.    And now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.  To overcome these challenges – to restore the soul and to secure the future of America – requires more than words.  It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy:  Unity.  Unity.  In another January in Washington, on New Year’s Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.  When he put pen to paper, the President said, “If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.”  My whole soul is in it.  Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this:  Bringing America together.  Uniting our people.  And uniting our nation.   Uniting to fight the common foes we face:  Anger, resentment, hatred.  Extremism, lawlessness, violence.  Disease, joblessness, hopelessness.  With unity we can do great things. Important things.  We can right wrongs.  We can put people to work in good jobs.  We can teach our children in safe schools.  We can overcome this deadly virus.  We can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health care secure for all.  We can deliver racial justice.  We can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world.    But  Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart.  The battle is perennial.  Victory is never assured.  Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our “better angels” have always prevailed.  In each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward.  And, we can do so now.  History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity.  We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors.  We can treat each other with dignity and respect.  We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature.  For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.  No progress, only exhausting outrage.  No nation, only a state of chaos.  This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward.  And, we must meet this moment as the United States of America.  If we do that,  We have never, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together.  And so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh.  All of us.  Let us listen to one another.  Hear one another. See one another.  Show respect to one another.  Politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path.  Every disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war.  And, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.  My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this.  America has to be better than this.  And,  Just look around.  Here we stand, in the shadow of a Capitol dome that was completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself hung in the balance.  Yet we endured and we prevailed.  Here we stand looking out to the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream.  Here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote.  Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office – Vice President Kamala Harris.  Don’t tell me things can’t change.  Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington National Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace.  And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground.  That did not happen.  It will never happen.  Not today.  Not tomorrow.  Not ever.  To all those who supported our campaign  To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart.  And if you still disagree, so be it.  That’s democracy. That’s America. The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps our nation’s greatest strength.  Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion.  And   Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love.  What are the common objects we love that define us as Americans?   Opportunity.  Security.  Liberty.  Dignity.  Respect.  Honor.  And, yes, the truth.  Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson.  There is truth and there are lies.  Lies told for power and for profit.  And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders – leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation — to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.     But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don’t look like you do, or worship the way you do, or don’t get their news from the same sources you do.  We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.  We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts.  If we show a little tolerance and humility.  If we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes just for a moment. Because here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you.  There are some days when we need a hand.  There are other days when we’re called on to lend one.  That is how we must be with one another.  And, if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future.  My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other.  We will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter.  We are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus.  We must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation.   We will get through this, together  The world is watching today.  So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we have come out stronger for it.  We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.  Not to meet yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s.  We will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example.  We will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security.  We have been through so much in this nation.  And, in my first act as President,  To those 400,000 fellow Americans – mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers.  We will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be.  Let us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country.  Amen.  This is a time of testing.  We face an attack on democracy and on truth.   Growing inequity.  The sting of systemic racism.   America’s role in the world.  Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways.  But the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities.  Now we must step up.  All of us.  It is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do.  And, this is certain.  We will be judged, you and I, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era.  Will we rise to the occasion?  Will we master this rare and difficult hour?  Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our children?   And when we do, we will write the next chapter in the American story.  It’s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me.  It’s called “American Anthem” and there is one verse stands out for me:  “The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day What shall be our legacy? What will our children say?… Let me know in my heart When my days are through America America  Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation.  If we do this then when our days are through our children and our children’s children will say of us they gave their best.  They did their duty.  They healed a broken land. My fellow Americans,  Before God and all of you       Not of personal interest, but of the public good.  And together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear.  Of unity, not division.  Of light, not darkness.  An American story of decency and dignity.  Of love and of healing.  Of greatness and of goodness.  May this be the story that guides us.  The story that inspires us.  The story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history.  We met the moment.  That democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrived.  That our America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world.  That is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow.  So, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time.  Sustained by faith.  Driven by conviction.  And, devoted to one another and to this country we love with all our hearts.  May God bless America and may God protect our troops.  Thank you, America.
