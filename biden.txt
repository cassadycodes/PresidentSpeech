							 South Court Auditorium 2:30 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Last week, we set a goal of 200 million shots by day 100 of our administration — double the original goal that I had set.  And to make that progress, over the last three days, we’ve had a record number of shots in arms with over 10 million shots recorded in the weekend.  Over 10 million shots in three days — that would have been inconceivable in January.The progress we have made on vaccinating this country is a great American story.  The federal government has stepped up, taken responsibility, and launched a massive federal vaccination program.  Governors and mayors of both political parties — Republicans and Democrats — have stepped up as well.  Our military, our National Guard, FEMA — they have all been incredible.  Healthcare providers, community leaders from all walks of life — so many volunteers of all ages and backgrounds stepped up as well.  And my fellow Americans, look at what we have done the past 10 weeks.  No other country has come close: 100 million shots in less than 60 days, and now we’re moving on to the next 100 million shots in just 40 days. You’ve heard me say it many times before: Our progress on vaccination is a stunning example that there is nothing — nothing this country cannot do if we put our minds to it and we do it together. But as I’ve also said, I will always give you it straight — straight from the shoulder.  Our work is far from over.  The war against COVID-19 is far from won.  This is deadly serious.We share the sentiment of Dr. Walensky, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The CDC expressed earlier today: This is not the time to lessen our efforts.  That’s what she said.  We could still see a setback in the vaccination program.  And most importantly, if we let our guard down now, we could see a virus getting worse, not better. You know, as many people as we have vaccinated, we still have more Americans left to go.  You know, we will administer more shots in March than any country on Earth.  But even so, we have to give more shots in April than we did in March.  Because we’re in the life and death race for the virus that is spreading quickly with cases rising again.  New variants are spreading.  And sadly, some of the reckless behavior we’ve seen on television over the past few weeks means that more new cases are to come in the weeks ahead.With vaccines, there’s hope, which is a — which is a very good thing, to state the obvious.  But people are let — are letting up on precautions, which is a very bad thing.  Look, to this point, cases have fallen two thirds since I took office.  Deaths have also fallen two thirds.  But now cases are going back up and, in some states, deaths are as well.  You know, we’re giving up hard-fought, hard-won gains.  And as much as we are doing, America, it is time to do even more.  All of us have to do our part, every one of us. So, let me start here: First, this week, thanks to my administration’s intensive work with vaccine manufacturers and distribution efforts, the amount of vaccines that are going to be available for vaccinators — vaccination sites will be a new record: 33 million doses of vaccine this week. By getting more vaccine supply to states, community health centers, and pharmacies, we can vaccinate the highest-risk Americans more quickly than we already are.  And then — and then we make it possible to open up supplies for all adults and to try to beat the renewed spread of this virus.As a result, I’m also pleased to announce that we’re on track this week — just 10 weeks after I became President — to achieve nearly 75 percent of Americans over the age of 65 getting at least one vaccination shot.  When I took office on January 20th, that number was 8 percent.  It’s going to 75 percent.  That’s a lot of grandparents who are now able to safely hug their grandchildren, and they couldn’t do so just a short time ago.And with the supply we’re releasing this week — just this week alone — there are more doors [sic] — there are more doses of vaccine available for seniors this week than any week thus far.  So, seniors, please, if you have not gotten your shot yet, get it this week.  Get it.Second, I’m reiterating my call for every governor, mayor, and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mask mandate.  Please, this is not politics.  Reinstate the mandate if you let it down.  And business should require masks as well.  The failure to take this virus seriously — precisely what got us in this mess in the first place — risks more cases and more dests [sic] — deaths.Look, as I do my part to accelerate the vaccine distribution and vaccinations, I need the American people to do their part as well.  Mask up.  Mask up.  It’s a patriotic duty. It’s the only way we ever get back to normal — to cheer together in stadiums full of fans; to gather together on holidays again safely; go to graduations, weddings.Third, I announced on March 11th I’d direct every state, territory, and Tribe to open up their vaccinations to all adults no later than May 1.I issued that order because moving beyond priority groups to enable all adults to get vaccinated is critical to having a July 4th that’s closer to normal.  I want this to come as quickly as possible. And I want to thank the governors — Democrats and Republicans — who have responded to this directive.  In fact, the vast majority of governors have set open access dates even earlier than the deadline of May 1st.  But in this race against a rapidly spreading virus, as fast as we are going, we need to go faster. So to make it easier for Americans to get vaccinated as the supply grows and vaccination eligibility expands, I’m directing my COVID team to ensure there is a vaccine site within 5 miles of 90 percent of all Americans by April 19th — three weeks from today.Look, we’re going to do this by growing from having 17,000 pharmacies giving out vaccination shots to nearly 40,000 pharmacies doing it within the next three weeks.  That will more than double the number of pharmacies where you can go get vaccinated.  But we aren’t stopping there. In the next three weeks, we’ll add 12 more federally run mass vaccination sites.  Every day at these sites, tens of thousands of people are able to drive up, get a vaccine shot while in their car, and leave in less than an hour.  And over 60 percent of the shots given at these sites goes to minority communities because they’re in minority communities.  We have to reach out.  They’re the ones most affected by the vacci- — by both the vaccine, but also by the pandemic.We’re also going to send more aid to states to expand the opening of more community vaccination sites — more vaccines, more sites, more vaccinators — all designed to speed our critical work. But we also need to make it easier for those who want shots but cannot access vaccination sites to get vaccinated.  This is also where we’re focused on the seniors most immediately.While we have made incredible progress in starting to vaccinate nearly three quarters of our seniors and now putting vaccination sites within 5 miles of 90 percent of all Americans, that still isn’t enough as far as we’re concerned.We know that there are a number of seniors and people with disabilities who may be isolated and have lack of access to transportation, and there are community groups that can help.  They’re trying to help now.So, our fourth announcement today is that I’m sending out millions of dollars, through the Department of Health and Human Service, to provide assistance, including transportation, so more vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities can get their shots because they get help to physically get there, to get the shot.  Neighbors helping neighbors: What a truly American effort.  We cannot let transportation be a barrier to any senior getting a vaccination. And so where does this put us?  We’re making progress on vaccinations, but cases are rising and the virus is spreading in too many places still.  That’s why, today, I’m taking these steps to make our American turnaround story a vac- — our vaccination program — move even faster.  Thanks to all the work we’ve done these past 10 weeks, the added steps I’m announcing today — with them — I’m pleased to announce that at least 90 percent of all adults in this country will be eligible to be vaccinated by April the 19th, just three weeks from now, because we have the vaccines.  For the vast, vast majority of adults, you won’t have to wait until May 1.  You’ll be eligible for your shot on April 19th.  Finally, 10 percent will be eligible no later than — the final 10 percent will be eligible no later than May 1.  And as I just said, due to the steps we’re taking today, 90 percent of Americans will be within five miles of a location where they can get a shot as of April the 19th.  So we’re moving toward “90/90” by April 19th.  That is, by April 19, three weeks from today, 90 percent of adults — people over 18 and over — will be eligible get vaccinated.  Ninety percent of all Americans will be living within five miles of a place they can get a shot.  And, of course, it will take time for everyone to get their appointment.  It’s a big country.  And as fast as we’re going, and we still have a long way to go to finish this vaccination effort.  In fact, we aren’t even there — we aren’t halfway yet.  But being at 90/90 just three weeks from today should give hope to the country.  Let me close with this: The progress we’re making is a significant testament to what we can do when we work together as Americans.  But as I’ve always said, we still need everyone to do their part.  We still are in a war with this deadly virus.  And we’re bolstering our defenses, but this war is far from won.  Together, we have so much to be proud of in the past 3 weeks — past more than 3 weeks; past 10 weeks.  We also have so much to be sorrowful about.  Nearly 1,000 Americans a day are still dying from COVID-19 as we approach 550,000 deaths in a single year.  Until this country is vaccinated, each of us has to do our part.  We have an obligation — a patriotic obligation: Wash your hands, stay socially distanced, wear a mask as recommended by the CDC, and get vaccinated.  Get your friends and family vaccinated when you can help.  Now is not the time to let down.  Now is not the time to celebrate.  It is time to do what we do best as a country: our duty, our jobs; take care of one another; and fight this to the finish.  We can and will do this, but don’t let up now.  Don’t let up now.  Thank you.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you very much.  Q    Mr. President, Dr. Walensky said she’s scared of an “impending doom” with COVID cases on the rise.  Are you? THE PRESIDENT:  I just explained that, I think, thoroughly.  I hope I did anyway.  Thank you. Q    Mr. President, do you believe that some states should pause their reopening efforts? THE PRESIDENT:  Yes. 2:44 P.M. EDT We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

EDT Q    Have you made a final decision on how you’re going to approach your legislative agenda?  Is it going to be one bill, or are you going to split it up into multiple bills? THE PRESIDENT:  I have, but I ain’t telling you.  (Laughs.) Q    Any reaction to what happened in Myanmar? THE PRESIDENT:  It’s terrible.  It’s absolutely outrageous.  And based on the reporting I’ve gotten, an awful lot of people have been killed totally unnecessarily. Q    Senator Chris Murphy said today that he thinks there’s a chance to get 60 votes for a background check proposal.  Are you prepared to make calls to Republicans to try to get it over the finish line? THE PRESIDENT:  Sure, I am.  Of course, I am.  I’m the only one that’s ever gotten it passed, man.  Everybody keeps wondering whether I cared about dealing with rational gun control.  The only gun control legislation ever passed was mine.  It’s going to happen again. Q    Mr. President, how close are you to naming a national cyber director? THE PRESIDENT:  Close. Q    Within days, sir? THE PRESIDENT:  Close. Q    Close? Q    (Inaudible) COVID cases are going up.  What’s going wrong in America? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, based on what I’m hearing, apparently people are letting their guard down.  But I have — I’m having a meeting with the team tomorrow, and I’ll get a better sense. Q    Mr. President, what have you given up for Lent? THE PRESIDENT:  I gave up all sweets for Lent.  You have no idea how hard it is for me. Q    What’s the first sweet you’re looking forward to having when it’s over? THE PRESIDENT:  Ice cream. Q    What are you going to do to sanction Myanmar?  What is the plan here for the U.S. reaction to what is going on? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re working on that now. Q    Mr. President, we’ve seen Republican senators at the border.  Former President Trump said he’s been asked by some Border Patrol agents to go to the border.  Do you think that would be productive?  And when — any timetable on when you might go? THE PRESIDENT:  We are putting in place a plan that I feel very confident about, and I don’t care what the other guy does. Thank you. Q    On Neera Tanden, sir, do you have a place in mind for her yet? Q    How concerning is the emerging partnership between China and Iran? THE PRESIDENT:  Been concerned about that for years. 4:14 P.M.

							 Via TeleconferenceWilmington, Delaware (March 26, 2021) 5:37 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, Mayor — can you hear me now?  I truly apologize to everybody, especially on a Friday afternoon, as the Mayor said.  I want to thank the Mayor for her leadership, and more importantly, I want to thank her for her friendship.  And for everyone on this call, you should know that Keisha endorsed me, as I said, very early in my campaign, back when most folks didn’t think I had a chance.  She stuck with me when things were bad and (inaudible).  But through it all, she believed in me, and I’m forever grateful.  But maybe the person I should be thanking most is Keisha’s mom.  Keisha often tells me stories about how her best polling source is her mom, and what her mom is hearing about at the bridge club every Saturday. Well, when Keisha’s mom said she believed in me, I guess that was good enough for Keisha.  And just like she had my back, I have hers. And we need her, and Atlanta needs her.  You know, we saw it just weeks after — just weeks after we found ourselves (inaudible) to the mass shooting.  When the Vice Pres- — when I — when the Vice President and I traveled to Atlanta, we met with the Mayor and saw her strength keeping the city together, especially for the Asian Amer- — the Asian American community that remains in fear and is hurting right now. And we’ve seen her leadership during this pandemic — believing in science and leading a city that’s home to a tremendous public servant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the CDC.  We saw her stand tall and speak out during the summer of protests and pain.  And during the campaign that tested our very democracy, she was always there.  So many of you stepped up as well.  And if anyone ever doubted that voting matters, Georgia just proved that it did.  If anyone ever wondered if one vote can make a difference, Georgia proved it 11,779 times.  And if anyone ever wondered if voting can change a country, Georgia just proved that.  And if you’re wondering whether Republican officials will finally stop their attacks on the right to vote and actually try and win over votes, they just proved yesterday they won’t.  It’s (inaudible) America and what they’re doing — that it cannot stand So, above all, Keisha knows democracy is not just about winning elections.  It’s about governing, making government work.  It’s about making government work for working families, for the people who are — who are the backbone of this country. And that’s why we fought so hard to pass the American Rescue Plan.  It’s making a difference. Just last week, we passed 100 million shots in arms in the first 58 days in office.  We’re going to get (inaudible) 200 million in my first 100 days.  That includes a $10 billion investment to make sure we reach the hardest-hit and highest- risk communities. And, yesterday, we reached 100 million checks for $1,400 into people’s pockets and their bank accounts.  By the time this money is distributed, 88 percent of all adults and children in Georgia will receive such a check.  That’s going to change their lives. The American Rescue Plan will cut child poverty literally in half, including for 171,000 Georgia children.  It provides $4 billion for Georgia’s schoolchildren, in grades K through 12, to keep them open and keep them open safely. And one of the biggest things for Georgia and the Atlantic — and Atlanta: Georgia is now eligible for about $2 billion in expanded Medicaid.  That means another 500,000 Georgians will be covered all across the state with Medicaid that they don’t have right now.  And that’s on top of the lower premiums and expanded coverage, if you have a plan through Obamacare.  Your state — the state of Georgia — will also get around $5 billion to make up for the lost revenues.  Local governments will get around $3.5 billion. That’s going to make it possible to keep police officers, firefighters, teachers, first responders on the job, rather than have to lay them off because of a lack of funding. And who is going to deliver this help on the ground?  The Mayor.  The Mayor.  But that’s just the beginning. And as we rescue the economy in the coming weeks, I’ll be laying out my vision for a Build Back Better plan to rebuild America’s own 21st century, modernizing our infrastructure — our transportation systems, our broadband systems, our water and power systems. And we’re going to make historic investments in research and development, and we’re going to create millions — and it’s not just me; it’s not just a Democratic think tank.  Wall Street has pointed out millions of good-paying jobs here in America — manufacturing, clean energy, and so much more.  Just manufacturing in general. A big piece of that, as the Mayor knows and as I promised on the campaign, is historic investment in historically Black colleges and universities to help the next generation of Black students get access to good-paying jobs now and in the future. We’re also going to invest in our families, making (inaudible) housing more affordable, and caregiving economy stronger for millions of Americans, mostly women and women of color who care for children and aging loved ones.  And they deserve to be paid well. All this is going to help us outcompete the rest of the world, and it will depend on government being able to work for the American people.  That’s why I need people like Keisha leading the way, and I really mean that. I’m going to close with this — I’ve kept you too long already: There is so much we can do if we do it together, if we stand together; if we once again believe and invest in science; if we stand up for justice and equality and the right of Americans to vote and have access to voting.  And Keisha is leading our efforts as Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee.  You have to remember, we’re here to help all the people of this country, the bottom up and the middle out, not just those in the top few. Folks, if we do that, then there’s not a single solitary thing we can’t do if we do it together.  So to Keisha and to all of you, I apologize for the mix -up.  I’m not — I don’t want to be fastidious about making sure (inaudible) to do this.  So I’m (inaudible) home, and we just got a little messed up here.  But I truly — I truly apologize.  And I — and again, let me thank all of you who — that we called on our contribution list, asking about Keisha (inaudible) coming through.  She is the real deal.  She’s bright.  She’s honorable.  She’s tough.  She has great integrity.  And it really matters that we have people like Keisha to (inaudible). So, Keisha, I want to thank you as well for being my buddy.  May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.  Have a good — have a good weekend.  Thank you. 5:44 P.M. EDT We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

							 More Americans voted in the 2020 elections than any election in our nation’s history. In Georgia we saw this most historic demonstration of the power of the vote twice – in November and then again in the runoff election for the U.S. Senate seats in January. Recount after recount and court case after court case upheld the integrity and outcome of a clearly free, fair, and secure democratic process. Yet instead of celebrating the rights of all Georgians to vote or winning campaigns on the merits of their ideas, Republicans in the state instead rushed through an un-American law to deny people the right to vote. This law, like so many others being pursued by Republicans in statehouses across the country is a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience. Among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over. It adds rigid restrictions on casting absentee ballots that will effectively deny the right to vote to countless voters. And it makes it a crime to provide water to voters while they wait in line – lines Republican officials themselves have created by reducing the number of polling sites across the state, disproportionately in Black neighborhoods. This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end. We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote. And I will take my case to the American people – including Republicans who joined the broadest coalition of voters ever in this past election to put country before party. If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people vote. ### We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

							 East Room 1:27 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Please, please sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Before I take questions, I want to make — give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the American people.First, on vaccinations: On December 8th, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people’s arms in my first 100 days. We met that goal last week by day 58 — 42 days ahead of schedule.Now, today, I’m setting a second goal, and that is: We will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people’s arms. That’s right: 200 million shots in 100 days.I know it’s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close — not even close — to what we are doing. And I believe we can do it.And today, we’ve made a historic investment in reaching the hardest-hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest-risk communities — as a consequence of the virus — by investing an addition $10 billion in being able to reach them.I also set a goal, before I took office, of getting a majority of schools in K through 8 fully open in the first 100 days. Now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, state education officials and leaders — a recent Department of Education Department survey shows that nearly half of the K-through-8 schools are open now full time, five days a week, for in-person learning. Not yet a majority, but we’re really close. And I believe, in the 35 days left to go, we’ll meet that goal as well.As of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people’s bank accounts. That’s real money in people’s pockets, bringing relief instantly, almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon.One final note: Since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we’re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. Since it was passed, a majority — a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that’s going to take place this year. They’re now projecting it will exceed 6 percent — a 6 percent growth in GDP.And just this morning, we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. That’s the first time in a year the number has fallen below the pre-pandemic high.So there are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and we still have a lot of work to do.But I can say to you, the American people: Help is here, and hope is on the way.Now I’ll be happy to take your questions.Zeke, the Associated Press.Q  Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I’d like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m going to — look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that’s why I put all my focus in the beginning — there are a lot of problems — put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems.And the other problems we’re talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they’ve been around a long time. And what we’re going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and — whether it’s immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.But the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they’re going to lose a family member, whether they’re going to be in a position where they’re not going to be — they’re going to lose their home because they can’t pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to — to pay their rent.So we’re going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that’s the reason why I focused as I have.And here’s the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to — is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I’m not going to do that; I’m just going to move forward and take these things as they come.Q  And just to — to follow up, Mr. President, can your presidency be a success if you can’t make progress on those four challenges: climate change, immigration reform, gun control, voting rights?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I plan on making progress on all of them, but that’s going to be for the American people to decide.I think — you know, I doubt whether — maybe you did; maybe others did. I thought — many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan I got passed, passed, without any Republican votes. A pretty big deal. It got passed. Growing the economy. People’s lives are changing.So let’s see what happens. All I know, I’ve been hired to solve problems — to solve problems, not create division.Okay. How about Yamiche?Q  Thanks so much, Mr. President. You’ve said over and over again that immigrants shouldn’t come to this country right now; this isn’t the time to come. That message is not being received. Instead, the perception of you that got you elected — as a moral, decent man — is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors.How do you resolve that tension? And how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go, given the fact that even though, with Title 42, there are some families that are staying? And is there a timeline for when we won’t be seeing these overcrowded facilities with — run by CPB [sic], when it comes to unaccompanied minors?THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I’m the nice guy; that’s the reason why it’s happening — that I’m a decent man or however it’s phrased. That — you know, that’s why they’re coming, because they know Biden is a good guy.The truth of the matter is: Nothing has changed. As many people came — 28 percent increase in children to the border in my administration; 31 percent in the last year of — in 2019, before the pandemic, in the Trump administration. It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year.In addition to that, there is a — and nobody — and, by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31 percent increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? That’s not the reason they’re coming.The reason they’re coming is that it’s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. Number two, they’re coming because of the circumstances in-country — in-country.The way to deal with this problem — and I started to deal with it back when I was a United States senator — I mean, Vice President — putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to deal with the root causes of why people are leaving.What did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn’t use it. He didn’t do it. And in addition to that, what he did — he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and — and has been — continued to be a problem for a long time. He, in fact, shut down the — the number of beds available. He did not fund HHS to get people to get the children out of those — those Border Patrol facilities where they should not be and not supposed to be more than a few days — a little while. But he dismantled all of that.And so what we’re doing now is attempting to rebuild — rebuild the system that can accommodate the — what is happening today. And I like to think it’s because I’m a nice guy, but it’s not. It’s because of what’s happened every year.Let me say one other thing on this. If you take a look at the number of people who are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back — are being sent back. Thousands — tens of thousands of people who are — who are over 18 years of age and single — people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home.We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We’re trying to work out now, with Mexico, their willingness to take more of those families back. But we — that’s what’s happening. They’re not getting across the border.And those who are coming across the border, who are unaccompanied children, we’re moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as I said. For example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70 percent are either 16 or 17 years old. We’re not talking about people ripping babies from mothers’ arms or little three-year-olds standing on the border. Less than — I think it’s one and a half percent fall in the category of the very young.So what we’re doing is we’re providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities, which no child — no one should be in any longer than 72 hours.And today, I went to — for example, I used all the resources available to me, went to the Defense Department, and — and the Secretary of Defense has just made available Fort Bliss — 5,000 beds be made easily available. Five thousand beds on the Texas border.So we’re building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It’s going to take time.And the other thing we’re doing, I might add — am I giving you too long an answer? Because if you don’t want the details —Q  (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but I mean — I don’t know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I’ll stop there and fin- —Q  My follow-up question is: One, if you could talk a little bit about which families — why they’re being allowed to stay. The families that are being allowed to stay, why they’re being allowed to stay.And in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, there’s — immigration is a big issue, of course, when it — related to the filibuster, but there’s also Republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer is calling it an “existential threat” to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration?Jim Clyburn, someone who — of course, who you know very well, has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rights.THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I’m going to deal with all of those problems. The question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate.Let’s go to the first question you asked — the first of the second question you asked. And that is: What about dealing with families? Why are not — some not going back? Because Mexico is refusing to take them back. They’re saying they won’t take them back — not all of them.We’re in negotiations with the President of Mexico. I think we’re going to see that change. They should all be going back, all be going back. The only people we’re not going to let sitting there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help are children.And what we’re doing there, and it’s an important point to understand — I know you understand; I don’t mean to say it that way — an important point to focus on: The vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States — a mother, a father, a close relative, a grandmom or a grandpop.What was happening before is it was taking literally weeks and weeks, and maybe even months, before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. Well, we’ve set up a system now where, within 24 hours, there’s a phone call made as that person or that child crosses the border. And then a verification system is being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called or that is actually a mom, a dad, and/or a close relative. They’re establishing that right off the bat.If it, in fact, is Mom or Dad, Dad says — to take the extreme case — “I got a birth certificate.” Then guess what? We’re getting that kid directly to that parent immediately.And so that’s going to reduce significantly — there’s two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a Border Patrol station. One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be held. The second way to do it is put them in a Health and Human Services facility that we’re occupying now — both licensed beds around the country that exist, as well as, for example, federal resources like Fort Bliss — to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while their fate is determined.Q  And can you answer the filibuster (inaudible)?THE PRESIDENT: Filibuster. Filibuster. You know, with regard to the filibuster, I believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago. And that is that — it used to be required for the filibuster — and I had a card on this; I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them — that it used to be that, that from between 1917 to 1971 — the filibuster existed — there was a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it’s being abused in a gigantic way.And, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote.So I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are — are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote — like the basic right to vote. We’ve amended the filibuster in the past.But here’s the deal: As you observed, I’m a fairly practical guy. I want to get things done. I want to get them done, consistent with what we promised the American people. And in order to do that in a 50-50 Senate, we’ve got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie, or I get 51 votes without her.And so, I’m going to say something outrageous: I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you — if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to — anyway —I — we’re going to get a lot done. And if we have to — if there’s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we’ll have to go beyond what I’m talking about.Okay. Hang on. Sorry. Oh, Seung Min — Ms. Kim.Q  Thank you, Mr. President, to follow up on the filibuster: So do you believe it should take 60 votes to end a filibuster on legislation or 51?THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) If we could end it with 51, we would have no problem. You’re going to have to — the existing rule — it’s going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster.But it’s not my expertise, in what the parliamentary rules and how to get there are. But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate, but in the meantime, we got a lot we can do while we’re talking about what we’re going to do about the filibuster.Let me get here. Okay, Cecilia Vega.  Q  I’d like to circle back to immigration, please. You just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year; you blamed the last administration. Sir, I just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where I met nine-year-old, Yossell, who walked here from Honduras by himself, along with another little boy. He had that phone number on him —THE PRESIDENT: Astounding.Q  — and we were able to call his family. His mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. That’s why she sent him alone from Honduras.So, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging — in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process — encouraging families like Yossell says to come?THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the idea that I’m going to say — which I would never do — “if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we’re just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side” — no previous administration did that either, except Trump. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it.That’s why I’ve asked the Vice President of the United States, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in the first place. It’s because of earthquakes, floods. It’s because of lack of food. It’s because of gang violence. It’s because of a whole range of things.That — when I was Vice President and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children, I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like — in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving is they couldn’t walk in the street because they were getting — their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence.Well, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say, “Okay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I’ll put the lighting in.” We got a contractor. We got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor; it did not go through the government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave.When this hurricane occurred — two hurricanes — instead of us going down and helping in a major way, so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn’t have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. We’re going to do a lot in our administration. We’re going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place.That mother did not sit around with — on the kitchen table and say, “You know, I got a great idea: The way I’m going to make sure my son get taken care of is I’m going to put a…” — how old was he, or she?Q  He’s — he’s nine. I also met a 10-year-old.THE PRESIDENT: A nine-year-old. “I’m going to send him on a thousand-mile journey across the desert and up to the United States because I know Joe Biden is a nice guy and he’ll take care of him.”What a desperate act to have to take. The circumstances must be horrible. So we can do something about that. That’s what the Vice President is going to be doing: what I did. When President Obama asked me to come and deal, I was in — I was in Turkey at the time, and he said, “You got to come home and take care of this.” So we put together a plan and it had an impact.And so, the question here is whether — how we go ahead and do this; what we do. There’s no easy answerQ  A quick follow, if I may.  Do you want to see these unaccompanied minors staying in this country, or should they be deported eventually?THE PRESIDENT: Well, the judgment has to be made whether or not — and in this young man’s case, he has a mom at home; there’s an overwhelming reason why he’d be put in a plane and flown back to his mom.Q  Final follow, sir. You mentioned circumstances that must be horrific. The Customs and Border Protection facility in Donna, Texas — I was there — is at 1,556 percent capacity —THE PRESIDENT: Yep.Q  — right now, with mostly unaccompanied minors. There are kids that are sleeping on floors. They are packed into these pods. I’ve spoken to lawyers who say that they — some of these children have not seen the sun in days. What’s your reaction — what is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility? Is what’s happening inside acceptable to you? And when is this going to be fixed?THE PRESIDENT: Is — that’s a serious question, right?Is it acceptable to me? Come on. That’s why we’re going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly. That’s why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That’s why I’ve been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely — not just children, but particularly children — to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what’s happening.That is totally unacceptable.Ken.Q  Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about Afghanistan. You face a May 1st deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from that country. As a candidate, in foreign affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. Can you commit to the American people that by May 2nd the U.S. will no longer have forces in Afghanistan?THE PRESIDENT: The answer is that it’s going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, it’s hard to get those troops out. So, what we’ve been doing — what I’ve been doing and what Secretary Blinken has been doing — has been — we’ve been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have NATO Allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we’re going to do so in a safe and orderly way.We’re in consultation, I said, with our allies and partners in how to proceed. And Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO Allies, particularly those who have forces there.And General Austin is — just met with Kayani [Ghani] and I’m waiting for the briefing on that. He is the — the “leader,” quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul. And there’s a U.N.-led process that’s beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people — how to end this war.But it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is: How and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it’s not being able to be worked out to begin with? How is that done? But we are not staying a long time.Q  You just said “if we leave.” Do you think it’s possible that we–THE PRESIDENT: We will leave. The question is when we leave.Q  Do you — sorry — do you believe, though, it’s possible we could have troops there next year?THE PRESIDENT: I — I can’t picture that being the case.Okay. Kristen.Q  Thank you very much, Mr. President. Given the conditions that were just laid out at the migrant facilities at the U.S. border, will you commit to allowing journalists to have access to the facilities that are overcrowded moving forward?THE PRESIDENT: I will commit when my plan, very shortly, is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well.Q  How soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities? We’ve obviously been allowed to be inside one, but we haven’t seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the American people a chance to see that. Will you commit to transparency on this issue, Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT: I will commit to transparency, and — as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we are doing right now.And one of the reasons I haven’t gone down — I have all my — my chief folks have gone down — is I don’t want to become the issue. I don’t want to be, you know, bringing all of the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So this is being set up, and you’ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving.Q  Okay. And just to be clear: How soon will that be, Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT: I don’t know, to be clear.Q  Okay. And do you bear responsibility for everything that’s happening at the border now? I hear you talking a lot about the past administration. You decided to roll back some of those policies, did you move too quickly to roll back (inaudible) policies?THE PRESIDENT: To roll back what? I’m sorry.Q  Did you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive orders of your predecessor?THE PRESIDENT: First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all — did not slow up the amount of immigration — and there’s many people coming.And rolling back the policies of separating children from — from their mothers, I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies of “Remain in Mexico,” sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and — I make no apologies for that.I make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became President that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so, I make no apologies for that.Q  If I could just ask you about foreign policy, Mr. President. Overnight, we learned that North Korea tested two ballistic missiles. What, if any, actions will you take? And what is your red line on North Korea?THE PRESIDENT: Let me say that, number one, U.N. Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested — number one. We’re consulting with our allies and partners. And there will be responses — if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly.But I’m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. So that’s what we’re doing right now: consulting with our allies.Q  Just a very quick follow-up —THE PRESIDENT: You’ve only got another hour now, okay?Q  Diplomacy: Can you define what you mean? And former President Obama warned the incoming President Trump that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching. Is that how you assess the crisis in North Korea?THE PRESIDENT: Yes.Okay. Hang on a second here, Kristen. Nancy, CBS.Q  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to go back to voting rights. And as Yamiche mentioned, Republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting, particularly, Democrats fear, impacting minority voters and young voters — the very people who helped to get you elected in November.Are you worried that if you don’t manage to pass voting rights legislation that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the House and the Senate in 2022?THE PRESIDENT: What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line, waiting to vote; deciding that you’re going to end voting at five o’clock when working people are just getting off work; deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances.It’s all designed — and I’m going to spend my time doing three things: One, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House, number one. Number two, educating the American public. The Republican voters I know find this despicable. Republican voters, the folks out in — outside this White House. I’m not talking about the elected officials; I’m talking about voters. Voters.And so I am convinced that we’ll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic what they’re trying to do, and it cannot be sustained.I’m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from — from becoming the law.Q  Is there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislation?THE PRESIDENT: The answer is “yes,” but I’m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now.Q  And then, on a related note, have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024? You haven’t set up a reelection campaign yet, as your predecessor had by this time.THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) My predecessor need do [sic] — needed to. My predecessor. Oh God, I miss him.Q  Have you — have you —THE PRESIDENT: No, the answer is “yes.” My plan is to run for reelection. That’s my expectation.Q  And then, on — on one other note, on bipartisanship: Your old friend, Mitch McConnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. Do you see it the same way he does? Have you rejected bipartisanship?THE PRESIDENT: No, I haven’t at all. I’ve been meeting — when is the last time a President invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues? Everything from how we work — we’re working with a group of 20 members of the Senate right now and House on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. And we’re working together on a bunch of things.But, look, I know Mitch well; Mitch knows me well. I would expect Mitch to say exactly what he said. But this is a matter of making sure that — I would like Republican — elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is that I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I’m doing.And so, unless Mitch says the last thing I did is — the last piece of legislation is so far left — well, then he ought to a look at his party. Over 50 percent of them must be over that edge as well because they support what I did.Okay. Where am I here? Let me see. Kaitlan.Q  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for you, but first I’d like to follow up on a question from Yamiche, and that’s on the filibuster.THE PRESIDENT: That counts as a question, but go ahead.Q  Okay. I’ll make it quick. It’s a quick question.THE PRESIDENT: No, no — you can.Q  Regarding the filibuster: At John Lewis’s funeral, President Barack Obama said he believed the filibuster was a “relic” of the Jim Crow era. Do you agree?THE PRESIDENT: Yes.Q  And if not, why not abolish it if it’s a relic of the Jim Crow era?THE PRESIDENT: Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let’s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It’s been abused from the time it came into being — by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let’s deal with the abuse first.Q  It sounds like you’re moving closer to eliminating the filibuster. Is that correct?THE PRESIDENT: I answered your question.Q  You also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelection.THE PRESIDENT: I said, “That is my expectation.”Q  So is that a “yes” that you are running for reelection?THE PRESIDENT: Look, I — I don’t know where you guys come from, man. I’ve never been able to travel. I’m a great respecter of fate. I’ve never been able to plan four and half, three and a half years ahead for certain.Q  And if you do —THE PRESIDENT: It —Q  If you do run, will Vice President Harris be on your ticket?THE PRESIDENT: I would fully expect that to be the case. She’s doing a great job. She’s a great partner. She’s a great partner.Q  And do you believe you’ll be running against former President Trump?THE PRESIDENT: Oh, come on. I don’t even think about — I don’t — I have no idea. I have no idea if there will be a Republican Party. Do you? I know you don’t have to answer my question, but, I mean, you know, do you?I mean, look, this is — the way I view things — I’ve become a great respecter of fate in my life. I set a goal that’s in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hardworking, decent American people who are getting — really having it stuck to them.I want to change the paradigm. I want to change the paradigm. We start to reward work, not just wealth. I want to change the paradigm.If you notice — don’t you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about that the cost and the taxes that had to be had — if there is any tax to be had, as they talk about it — in dealing with the — the act that we just passed which puts money in people’s pockets — ordinary people.Did you hear them complain when they passed close to a $2 trillion Trump tax cut — 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Did you hear them talk about that all? I love the fact that they’ve found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget. It’s kind of amazing.When the federal budget is saving people’s lives, they don’t think it’s such a good idea. When the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans — 90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars not paying a cent in taxes; reducing taxes to the point that people who are making — you know, if you’re a husband and wife, a schoolteacher and a cop, you’re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is — something is wrong. Their newfound concern.I’m concerned — look, I meant what I said when I ran. And a lot of you still think I’m wrong, and I respect that. I said, “I’m running for three reasons: to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the American political system; two, to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class, hardworking people, and people struggling to get in the middle class. They built America, and unions built them.” The third reason I said I was running was to unite the country. And, generically speaking, all of you said, “No, you can’t do that.” Well, I’ve not been able to unite the Congress, but I’ve been uniting the country, based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to.So, from my perspective, you know, it’s a — to me, it’s about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people — just hardworking people. People get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able have a little bit of breathing room, being able to have — make sure that they go to bed not staring at the ceiling, like my dad, wondering whether — since he didn’t have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. These are basic things. Basic things.And I’m of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered Republicans, by and large, share that — that same — that same view, that same sense of what is — you know, what’s appropriate.Justin. Justin Sink, Bloomberg.Q  Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that you’ve been in office for a couple months. There’s obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical, and there’s the continued human rights abuses.So, today, I’m wondering: Are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China? Are you considering banning imports of forced-labor products? And would you consider cutting off U.S. investment or Chinese access to international payment systems?THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, they’re each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about.I’ve known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly, by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had, because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the President of the United States to spend time with the vice president of another country. But it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China.So, I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter — my interpreter and his — going into great detail. He is very, very straightforward. Doesn’t have a democratic — with a small “D” — bone in his body. But he’s a smart, smart guy. He’s one of the guys, like Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can’t function in an ever — an ever-complex world.So, when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were — his people were on call as well as mine, listening — we had a two-hour conversation. For two hours.And we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I’ve told him in person on several occasions: that we’re not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition.Two, that we’ll have strong competition but we’ll insist that China play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.Thirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we’re going to deal with China effectively, and we’re going to need three things to do that. I tell him, our people. First, we’re going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign and I say it again. And we’re — and I’m setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that, you know, back in the ‘60s, we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today, it’s 0.7 percent. I’m going to change that. We’re going to change that.The future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. And so what I’m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent.One of the reasons why I’ve set up the — the PAB [PCAST] — the President’s board with scientists and the like, again — is we’re going to invest in medical research — cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, the things — industries of the future — artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech. And we’re going to make real investments. China is out investing us by a longshot, because their plan is to own that future.The third — the second thing we’re going to do is we’re going to reestablish our alliances. And I’ve been very clear with him, it’s not anti-Chinese. And we’ve talked about it.I want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this — as a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine; we’ve been going close to an hour. I’m happy to go longer. But one of the things that I’m going to be doing, I’m going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in Europe and very shortly — I think within the next hour or so. I don’t know the exact time.And earlier this month — and apparently it got the Chinese’s attention; that’s not why I did it — I met with our allies and how we’re going to hold China accountable in the region: Australia, India, Japan, and the United States — the so-called Quad. Because we have to have democracies working together.Before too long, I’m going to have — I’m going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we’re going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules — to follow the rules — whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea, or their agreement made on Taiwan, or a whole range of other things.And the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with Xi is he understands — he makes no pretense about not understanding what I’m saying any more than I do him — I pointed out to him: No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country. And I said as — “And, Mr. President, as I’ve told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom. America values human rights. We don’t always live up to our expectations, but it’s a values system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we’re going to continue, in an unrelenting way, to call to the attention of the world and make it clear — make it clear what’s happening.” And he understood that. I made it clear that no American President — at least one did — but no American President ever back down from speaking out of what’s happening to the Uighurs, what’s happening in Hong Kong, what’s happening in-country. That’s who we are. The moment a President walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. It’s who we are. So I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don’t criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That’s not going to happen on my watch because the United States are going to continue to grow and expand. Q  All right. Just to follow up on the meeting of democracies: Is that where you expect, in a multilateral way, to make these decisions about sanctions? Or — THE PRESIDENT: No, that’s not where I make the decision; that’s where I make sure we’re all on the same page. All on the same page. Look, I predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded: autocracy or democracy? Because that is what is at stake, not just with China. Look around the world. We’re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment? How will they do that? And are democracies equipped — because all the people get to speak — to compete? It is clear, absolutely clear — and most of the scholars I dealt with at Penn agree with me around the country — that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies. If you notice, you don’t have Russia talking about communism anymore. It’s about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country — that’s what’s at stake here. We’ve got to prove democracy works. Q  And, Mr. President, sorry, I know you haven’t had a chance to address the tragedies in Georgia and Colorado. You had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control. Wondering if you’ve made a decision either about sending the manufacturer liability bill that you had promised on day one to Capitol Hill, or executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and states to battle gun control. THE PRESIDENT: All the above. It’s a matter of timing. As you’ve all observed, successful presidents — better than me — have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they’re doing — order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done. The next major initiative is — and I’ll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh, in detail — is to rebuild the infrastructure — both physical and technological infrastructure in this country — so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs. Really good-paying jobs. And some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal and initiative. I still think the majority of the American people don’t like the fact that we are now ranked, what, 85th in the world in infrastructure. I mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel, ports that you can get in and out of quickly, so businesses decide. Some of you, if you were ever local reporters, and you found your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community, what’s the first thing that businesses asked? “What’s the closest access to — access to an interstate highway? How far am I from a freight rail? Is the water — is the water available? Is there enough water available for me to conduct my business?” All the things that relate to infrastructure. We have somewhere — I asked the staff to write it down for me, and they did — not for this, but for a longer discussion. We have somewhere, in terms of infrastructure — we have — we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. China is investing three times more in infrastructure than the United States is. Bridges: More than one third of our bridges — 231,000 of them — need repairs. Some are physical safety risks or preservation work. One in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. That’s 186,000 miles of highway. Aviation: 20 percent of all flights — 20 percent of all flights weren’t on time, resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. Six to ten million homes in America still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. We have over 100,000 wellheads that are not capped, leaking methane. What are we doing? And, by the way, we can put as many pipefitters and miners and — to work capping those wells at the same price that they would charge to dig those wells. So, I — I just find it frustrated — frustrating to talk about.Last point I’ll make on the infrastructure — and I apologize for spending more time on it, but — is that if you think about it, it’s the place where we will be able to significantly increase American productivity, at the same time providing really good jobs for people. But we can’t build back to what they used to be. We have to build — the environment has — global warming has already done significant damage.The roads that used to be above the water level — didn’t have to worry about where the drainage ditch was — now you got to rebuild them three feet higher. Because it’s not going to go back to what it was before; it will only get worse, unless we stop it.There’s so much we can do. Look at all of the schools in America. Most of you live in the Washington area now. But in your hometowns — I don’t know where you’re all from — how many schools where the kids can’t drink the water out of the fountain? How many schools are still in the position where there’s asbestos? How many schools in America we’re sending our kids to don’t have adequate ventilation? How many homes, buildings, office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they can’t hold in the heat or the air conditioning because it leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections? It’s amazing.So there’s so much we can do that’s good stuff, makes people healthier, and creates good jobs.And I think that I got one more question here. Janet from Univision.Q  Thank you, Mr. President. We, too, have been reporting at the border. And just like Cecilia, we ran into a pair of siblings who came in on Monday, who were detained by CBP — had the phone number for their mother who lives in the U.S.  We have contacted the mother. That’s the only way they know her kids are here because CBP, today, Thursday, has not contacted that mother. So when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and expediency and processing?THE PRESIDENT: Well, they’re already getting better, but they’re going to get real — they’ll get a whole hell of lot better real quick, or we’re going to hear of some people leaving, okay?We can get this done. We’re going to get it done.I had a long meeting with the entire team and several Cabinet-level officers the other night. We’re going to be moving, within the next — within the next week, over 100,000 — I mean, 1,000 people out of the Border Patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. We’re going to significantly ramp up. We’re already out there contacting everyone, from getting some of the employees at HHS — and there’s a lot of them doing other things — and move them into making those calls. We’re in a — we’re in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done.But I admire the fact that you were down there; you’re making the calls yourself. It’s real.The next thing that has to happen though — as you well know has to happen — there have to be some certitude that this is the — actually mom, dad, or whomever. And there’s ways to do that. There’s ways to do that — a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card, you know? “What was your dog’s name?” kind of a thing. I’m being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data, from DNA to — to birth certificates, which takes longer. So, I want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possible.Q  As you well know, treating the root cau- — causes in Latin America doesn’t change things overnight. How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S. when things will not get better in their countries right away?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I can’t guarantee that. But I know, you know, that old thing: The journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step.You know as well as I do; you cover it: You have serious — it’s not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in Guatemala — I mean, in — in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe, saying, “I got a great idea. Let’s sell everything we have. Give it to a coyote. Have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don’t speak the language. Won’t that be fun? Let’s go.” That’s not how it happens. People don’t want to leave.When my great grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn’t want to leave. But they had no choice. So you got — we can’t — I can’t guarantee we’re going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people.And the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out: I realize it’s much more heart wrenching — and it is — to deal with a five- and six- and seven-year-old. But you went down there, and you saw: The vast majority of these children — 70 percent — are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. Doesn’t make it — that doesn’t make it good, bad, or indifferent. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night — and there’s some; that’s true. That’s why we got to act.And yesterday, I asked my team — both the director of the two agencies, as well as others — I asked them what would they, in fact — and I asked their opinion because they’re the experts — but I said, “Focus on the most vulnerable immediately.”But there’s no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can’t be made in the first 48 hours and begin.Q  If I may ask one last question: Have you had any talks with Senate Republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the House until the situation at the border has been resolved?THE PRESIDENT: No, because I know they have to posture for a while. They sort of got to get it out of their system. This is a — but I’m ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem and make the situation better.But, folks, I’m going. Thank you very, very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.2:29 P.M.

							 South Court Auditorium 5:09 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  Megan and Margaret, thank you.  Thank you for being here.  And to all your teammates virtually, thank you as well.  I’m an unadulterated fan.  Not a joke.  Not a joke.  And both of you and your entire team — I’m not joking — have inspired our daughters and our granddaughters, who, I might add, are all really good athletes: one two-time All-State; my niece, All-American.  There’s a whole lot of talent in the Biden family athletics, almost all on the women’s side of the equation.  But I — really, thank you for what you’ve done. You know, you’re all heroes for so many people — and that’s not hyperbole to suggest that — on and off the field.  You know, and it matters that you lent your voice to the issues and the issue of fair pay and decency for so many years.  Megan, it’s hard to believe it was almost a year ago that we met virtually during the campaign.  I said it last April, when we spoke, and I’ll say it again: The fact that Jill and I get to talk with you and your teammates makes us heroes with our granddaughters.  Not a joke.  I went so far as I took — they might may say — a privilege of getting our granddaughter Maisy, who is a rising junior at the University of Pennsylvania — up taking a course right now — I got her on the phone so she — all she wanted to do was meet both of these women and meet them virtually.  And she’s a soccer player.  And as Jill mentioned, seeing you win the World Cup back in 2015, that was an incredible moment for our family and our country.  And I didn’t bore you with all the pictures we still have walking on the field — (laughter) — no, I’m serious — and off the field.  You all made me a hero with my granddaughters.  And the reason we’re here today is because it’s Equal Pay Day, which has been around for 25 years.  It was declared 25 years ago — Equal Pay Day — though not enough people know about that and — and they — as they should. You know, it’s a day that measures how much longer women typically have to work to match what men make in a single year.  That’s what Jill was talking about.  And it’s shocking when you look at the numbers.  Twelve years ago, when President Obama and I came into office, the very first law we enacted was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and Lilly was standing at our side.  This year — that year, I should say, in 2009, we marked — Equal Pay Day occurred in late April.  By late April, women will have made, at that time, on average, what men make in 12 months.  They had to go all the way through January, February, March, and April to catch up.  That meant that it took women until April of 2009 to earn the same amount of money that a man made in all of 2008.  Another way to look at it is, it took more than 15 months for a woman to earn the same amount that a man made in 12.  And more than three extra months — it’s more than that.  And it’s even longer for women of color.  And it’s wrong.  This year, Equal Pay Day falls in late March, which is a little bit better, but not much — from late April to late March.  And, frankly, we shouldn’t be satisfied until Equal Pay Day is no longer even necessary to mention at all.  The reality though is that in nearly every job — more than 90 percent of the occupations — women still earn less than men: 82 cents on the dollar on average.  For AAPI women, it’s 87 cents for every dollar a white man earns.  For Black women, it’s 63 cents.  For Native American women, it’s 60 cents.  For Hispanic women, it’s 55 cents.  It doesn’t matter if you’re an electrician, an accountant, or part of the best damn soccer team in the world, the pay gap is real.  And this team is living proof that you can be the very best at what you do and still have to fight for equal pay. You know, as Jill mentioned, this pandemic has only exacerbated the problem.  Women are on the frontlines as essential workers, particularly women of color, in hospitals, grocery stores, childcare facilities, farms, factories, but they’re still earning less.  More than 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce since the pandemic started — 2 million.  And now we’re at the lowest rate of women participation in the labor force that we’ve been in more than 30 years.  Let me say it again: The lowest — the lowest percent of women in the workforce — had to go back 30 years to get to where we are today. A lot of that is because so much extra weight of caregiving and responsibility is falling on their shoulders.  It causes women to miss work, cut hours, and leave their jobs and care for their children and aging loved ones.  That in and of itself sows some discrimination.  How many men are staying home and doing it, and the woman’s staying in the workforce? It undermines financial security.  And, by the way, it’s hard.  I was a single parent with two children after my first wife and daughter were killed well over 40 years ago.  And the fact of the matter is, I was a U.S. senator.  I was 29 years old.  I was making $42,000 a year, and I couldn’t afford help to take care of my kids while I worked.  Thankful- — thankfully, my mother — my sister gave up her job.  My brother — they helped me raise my kids.  It undermines financial security for women and families.  It hurts our entire economy when we lose the talent and hard work of so many people. In the American Rescue Plan you’ve heard so much about that we just passed, it was designed to address this core challenge.  It puts money directly into the pockets of people who need it the most: $1,400 checks for 85 percent of American households.  The hundredth million check has been deposited as of today, and many more are on the way.  It also expanded the Child Care Tax Credit. And here’s what that means, for those who don’t know: Right now, if you file for federal income tax, you get up to a $2,000 credit for each child.  But if you need help the most, if you’re making a minimum wage job and you don’t have to — you don’t make enough to pay federal income tax, then you don’t get this credit.  But because of the American Rescue Plan we passed, if you have two children under the age of six, for example, and you’re making $7.25 an hour — which is the minimum wage that so many people are making — you’ll get a check for $3,600 per child or $7,200.  Roughly, you get $500 a month mailed to you by the federal government.  That’s life-changing.  The American Rescue Plan is going to cut poverty across the board in America by about 31 percent.  And that’s a significant lift up for women.  The law provides $360 billion for funding state and local governments.  What that means is that’s going to prevent layoffs on jobs often held by women — nurses, teachers, healthcare workers, home healthcare aides — because the states have to balance their budget, because if they can’t — because of the lack of income coming in without the help from the federal government — they’ll have to lay off those essential workers. And the law also includes $130 billion to reopen our schools safely; $40 billion for — invest in childcare investments; $160 billion to get the country vaccinated and beat this pandemic.  All this is going to give millions of women, including many moms and dads too, the freedom to rejoin the workforce and make the career choices that are best for them and their families. But there’s so much more we need to do.  So much more.  We need the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act — the bill to remove loopholes in the law allowing employers to justify gender pay disparities.  It would help hold employers accountable for systemic pay discrimination.  It would help level the playing field for women and people of color by making it easier for workers to challenge the disparities as a group.  It would increase pay transparency.  By that, I mean, you know, there’s a whole range of American corporations — if you sign the Fortune 500 — you sign up with them, you cannot reveal — it says in your contract you cannot reveal your salary to another employee.  Why is that?  They don’t want me sitting there saying, “Well, I’m making $60,000.”  And the woman doing the same job, and she looks and said, “You’re making 60?  I’m making 40.”  They actually try to hide it.  That’s what I mean by transparency.  Some employers may not allow you to know exactly, like I said, how much the person sitting next to you is making.  Some may even discipline you for asking that.  That has to change.  Too often, secrecy is part of the problem.  We know information is power.  You can’t solve the problem if you don’t know you’re not getting paid fairly.  My administration is going to fight for equal pay — for it to become a reality for all women.  It’s about justice.  It’s about fairness.  It’s about living up to our values and who we are as a nation.  Equal pay makes all of us stronger. It’s not just women who care about this.  I’ve been around the country.  I’ve gone right into union halls and asked the men in the room, “How many of you — how would you feel if your wife or your sister didn’t earn the same amount of money as the man doing the same job next to you?”  And you hear them say — you hear them respond they don’t like it.  Why?  When your spouse or your sister is making the same amount of money the man she’s standing next is making, it means that when the hot water heater breaks, you can replace it.  You can get four new tires on the car.  It means everybody’s life is made better in that family.  Let me close with this: that to come out of this crisis and build back better, we need to erase the gender pay gap by ensuring that women have access to good-paying jobs; by raising wages for working folks and fighting for the right to organize and collectively bargain, because we know unions lift women’s wages even more than they lift men’s; and by investing our care — in our care infrastructure — our care infrastructure — in paid leave, childcare, homecare — so that people can care for their families and also go to work.  There’s a lot to do, but together we can ensure that our daughters have all the same rights and opportunities as our sons.  And if we’re able to do this, it’ll be transformational for our nation.  That’s the goal.  That’s what this is all about.  That’s what this team, all of you, are all about. Let me make one more point.  You know, I’ve told my daughters, granddaughters from the time they got old enough to understand what I was saying — and I mean it: There’s not a single thing a man can do that a woman can’t do as well or better.  Not a single thing.  I was among the first senators ever to appoint a woman to the Naval Academy.  I was just able to, as President of the United States, appoint two women as four-star generals, who now are combatant commanders.  Three out of the six are combatant commanders, and they’re women.  Women.  There are so many, some in the Congress, who were jet fighter pilots flying at twice the speed of sound.  So many doing so much.  But this soccer team, America’s team, has done more to lift up people’s sense of who they can be, particularly young girls and women, above anything that’s been done.  So, as President of the United States, I thank you.  I thank you for the example you’ve set and for your willingness to say, “Look, we’re not going to take it anymore.  We’re not going to take it.”  Figuratively speaking, “You can take my trophies, but you can’t take my pride.”  As I said, my dad used to say, “Joey, a job is…” — when he lost his job and had to get another one.  We had to move.  He’d say, “You know, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about respect.  It’s about your sense of yourself and your self-worth.  It’s about your place in the community.”  That’s what this is all about, and that’s why you guys are leading the way.  And now it’s my great pleasure and honor — I’d like you to stand next to me, if you would, while I sign a proclamation making Equal Pay Day — naming it — an expression of our commitment to seek equal pay as we build back better and restore this economic growth.  Thank you, folks.  I’m going to sign it now.  Come on over here.  The title of the proclamation is “National Equal Pay Day 2021.” THE FIRST LADY:  You can move up.  (Laughter.) MS. RAPINOE:  I’m checking.  Just making sure it says what it says.  (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:  That’s what it says.  MS. RAPINOE:  I know.  Joseph R. Biden. THE PRESIDENT:  Junior.  (Laughter.) MS. RAPINOE:  Junior.  Junior. THE PRESIDENT:  My dad.  He was a fine man.  It says “Equal pay is a reminder of the work that still remains to advance equal — equality and ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to reach their full potential.”  Like you guys. THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thanks, everybody. THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you. 5:23 P.M. EDT We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

EDTTHE PRESIDENT:  Well folks, today I have two announcements to make.  One, is we’ve got ourselves a Secretary.  Xavier, welcome.SECRETARY BECERRA:  Thank you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT:  Thanks for being willing to do this, and I really appreciate.  And also today, I’ve — I said when we became a team and got elected, that the Vice President was going to be the last person in the room.  She didn’t realize that means she gets every assignment.  (Laughs.) But the Vice President and I, and all of us here, have been working very hard to — to pass the legislation that — that is going to beat this virus, as well as get people back to work and change their prospects.  And so, she’s traveling all over the country working that.In addition to that, there’s about five other major things she’s handling, but I’ve asked her, the VP, today — because she’s the most qualified person to do it — to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that help — are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border.And, you know, back when I was Vice President, I got a similar assignment, but one of the things we did was we made sure that we got a bipartisan agreement with Democrats and Republicans to provide over $700 million to the countries in the Northern Triangle to determine the best way to keep people from coming is keep them from wanting to leave.And the reason why so many people were leaving, we learned, was that not only gang violence and trafficking and cartels, but natural disasters, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes.  And so it’s not like someone sits around a hand-hewnen [sic] — hand-hewn table somewhere in Guatemala and says, “I’ve got a great idea:  Let’s sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, have him take our kids or us to the border of America, take us across, leave us in the desert.  We don’t speak the language.  Won’t that be fun?”One of the ways we learned is that if you deal with the problems in country, it benefits everyone.  It benefits us, it benefits the people, and it grows the economies there.Unfortunately, the last administration eliminated that funding — did not engage in it, did not use it — even though there was over $700 million to help get this done.  We’re reinstituting that program.  And there are — as I said, there are many factors as to why people leave in the first place. But this is — this is the — the source of one of the reasons why we’ve had such a — before we took office, in the midst of the last administration’s somewhat draconian policies of separating children from their parents, et cetera, what happened was that we — we found that there were a serious spike in the number of people heading to the southern border, even in the midst of that.  And as — as Alejandro can tell you, is that was because there were serious natural disasters that occurred in those countries.  They were coming north, and we did nothing to do any — much about it. So this new surge we’re dealing with now started with the last administration, but it’s our responsibility to deal with it humanely and to — and to stop what’s happening.And so, this increase has been consequential, but the Vice President has agreed — among the multiple other things that I have her leading — and I appreciate it — agreed to lead our diplomatic effort and work with those nations to accept re- — the returnees, and enhance migration enforcement at their borders — at their borders.We’re already talking with Mexico about that; she’s already done that.  We’re going to be dealing with a full team now that we have to be able to deal with the problem here at home, but also to deal with it now in terms of in country. And I can think of nobody who — who is better qualified to do this than a former — this is a woman who ran the second-largest attorney general’s office in America — after the U.S. — after the United States Attorney General — in the state of California, and has done a great deal upholding human rights, but also fighting organized crime in the process. So it’s not her full responsibility and job, but she’s leading the effort because I think the best thing to do is to put someone who, when he or she speaks, they don’t have to wonder about is that where the President is.  When she speaks, she speaks for me.  Doesn’t have to check with me.  She knows what she’s doing, and I hope we can move this along. But — so, Madam Vice President, thank you.  I gave you a tough job, and you’re smiling, but there’s no one better capable of trying to organize this for us.THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Mr. President and for having the confidence in me.  And there’s no question that this is a challenging situation.  As the President has said, there are many factors that lead precedent to leave these countries.  And while we are clear that people should not come to the border now, we also understand that we will enforce the law and that we also — because we can chew gum and walk at the same time — must address the root causes that — that cause people to make the trek, as the President has described, to come here. And I look forward to engaging in diplomacy with government, with private sector, with civil society, and — and the leaders of each in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, and ensure shared prosperity in the region. We will collaborate with Mexico and other countries throughout the Western hemisphere.  And as part of this effort, we expect that we will have collaborative relationships to accomplish the goals the President has and that we share. I also look forward to working with members of the Congress who, I think, share our perspective on the need to address root causes for the migration that we’ve been seeing.  And needless to say, the work will not be easy, but it is important work.  It is work that we demand — and the people of our countries, I believe, need — to help stem the tide that we have seen. So thank you, Mr. President, for your confidence.  Thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you for willing to do it.  Now we’re going to get down to business here.  And, Ron, who am I turning this over to?2:23 P.M. EDT We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

Q    Can Americans feel confident in the AstraZeneca vaccine? THE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t gotten the final report today.  We haven’t used it at all.  We have it available, but we haven’t used it.  And I don’t know what’s — I’ve been gone all day.  I don’t know what’s happened today.  Q    Have you spoken to Dr. Fauci about it? THE PRESIDENT:  Pardon me? Q    Have you spoken to Dr. Fauci about it? THE PRESIDENT:  Not as of today.  No, I haven’t.  Thank you. Q    Will you — will you increase the number of doses you’re going to give Mexicans and Canadians?  THE PRESIDENT:  Well, that — that depends on how — what is finally approved.  Okay?  Thank you.  Q    On North Korea, sir: Do you consider that to be a real provocation by North Korea — the missile launch? THE PRESIDENT:  No.  According to the Defense Department, it’s business as usual.  There’s no new — there’s no new wrinkle in what they did. Q    Does it affect diplomacy at all?

							 Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research InstituteColumbus, Ohio 5:26 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, almost getting into evening.  Before I begin, as the congresswoman said, earlier today at the White House, I addressed the mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado.  While the investigation is ongoing — and I spent time on the telephone with the Attorney General, as well as the head of the FBI, this — the investigation is still ongoing. My heart goes out to the families of the victims and the survivors.  I want to — I want to commend the heroic actions of Officer Eric Talley — the father of seven children, who left for work yesterday morning assuming he’d be able to go home — and for the ultimate sacrifice for others. Now, let me turn to why I came today: to talk about, initially, the American Rescue Plan and the progress we’re making on tackling COVID.  Tameka, thank you for sharing your stories and what you’re doing — my daughter is also a social worker, and you have a profound impact on people’s lives — and all you do to connect folks here in Ohio with the coverage and care they need.  I want to thank Joyce, Congresswoman, for sticking with me during the day, and Marcy, my old friend — good to see you, Marcy.  Thanks for being here.  And Tim Ryan.  I always kid with Tim.  If you’re — if I got to be in a foxhole, he’s the guy I want to be with.  He always keeps his word, does exactly what he says he’s going to do.  And it’s great seeing you, Tim.  My best to the family.  And Madam President, thanks for having served in the Obama-Biden administration, and you’re doing an incredible job here. And all of the docs that are here that I got a chance to meet with today: Thank you.  You are — you’re an incredible group of individuals. I also want thank Sherrod Brown — who wanted to be here today, but he had to be in Washington to cast important votes in the United States Senate. Look, I want everyone to be aware that there are three key parts to the American Rescue Plan all of my colleagues supported here.  First, we’re going to more rapidly acquire — and we set out to more rapidly acquire enough vaccine to vaccinate every single American quicker than anticipated. And what my COVID team and — went through — and with the use of the Defense Production Act, we’ve been able to organize and help increase the number of doses in a much shorter time. So, by the end of May, we’re going to have on hand roughly 600 million doses — enough for every American.  And the American Rescue Plan is also going to provide the funding for more vaccinations, vaccination sites, vaccinators, and the paraphernalia needed to put that vaccine in one’s arm.  In addition, there is a second important piece of that plan.  It’s focused on dealing with the economic deprivation so many Americans have become subject to — a consequence to this virus through no fault of their own.  Millions have lost their jobs, and they’re still out of work.  Around 11 million children in America are going hungry through no fault of their own.  But as a result of the pandemic and the economic crisis, millions of Americans are not able to maintain their mortgage payments or rental payments and have found themselves on the verge of being evicted and having their homes repossessed. But we stepped in, and we prevented that from happening with the American Rescue Plan.  Hundreds of thousands of businesses are now — not going to go under, but they’re going to have an idea — an opportunity to reopen and have the financial assistance to be able to do it the right way and safely. Schools closed and children losing up to a year or more in learning capacity.  You’re ahead of the (inaudible) here in Ohio, but, across the nation, the help was badly needed, and we’ve now provided the funding for that. Because of isolation — and violence against women is up; abuse of children is up — and the need for mental health problems — to deal with mental health problems and the consequence of them is up, as a consequence of COVID.  And, in addition to that, suicides are up.  The second — so, second, the American Rescue Plan brings relief to a population that is badly hurting.  And one more element of our response is that — first and foremost, is the commitment to get Americans a $1,400 check per person, including per child.  So, a firefighter and school teacher making $120,000 combined, with two kids, are going to get a $5,6000 in cash. If they already have an account online with the IRS, which many do, by tomorrow, we will have distributed 100 million of those checks just since the legislation passed.  We’re on the verge of doing that as of tomorrow.  But for someone who doesn’t have direct deposit, they’re getting a check in the mail for all of that.  So we expand the child — we also expanded the Childcare Tax Credit.  Right now, if you file your federal income tax, you’ll get to a $2,000 deduction for every child you have.  But if you’re making the minimum wage, you don’t earn enough to file for federal taxes.  But because of the American Rescue Plan, if you have two children, for example, under the age of six, you’re going to get a check for $3,600 if you have a child.  And so, if you have two children, $7,200 will be paid on a monthly basis.  This is going to be life changing.  It’s estimated this will do more to end child poverty in America than anything we’ve ever done.  There’s the Earned Income Tax Credit.  If you are over the age of 19 and not a fulltime student and you are a childless worker, now you will get a check for $1,500 if you file.  Small businesses not only will be able to borrow money to keep business afloat, but get loan forgiveness in improving your business to get us back in the game. And, by the way, all of this — economists left, right, and center argue and acknowledge — will create 7 million more jobs and increase economic growth.  Increase economic growth. There’s so much more, but help is here.  But I’m here in this great hospital to talk about a third way to help.  And that is for your health — the third type of help, and that’s healthcare. I just concluded a tour of the Radiation Oncology Department here at the James Cancer Center, which was expanded thanks to a $100 million grant in the Affordable Care Act that Sherrod Brown was instrumental in making happen.  That’s in addition to the research funding Ohio State received under the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot.  Because of our investments, this department has gone from being able to treat 60 to 70 patients a day to nearly 300 a day.  This place is a source of hope.  I have said that I want to — when I ran, I said I wanted to be a President who would preside over the end of cancer as we know it.  And when we see the strides we’ve made — you talk to the docs and researchers — I can tell you, it’s within our reach.  We’re all benefited from the breakthroughs pioneered by the Defense Department, for example, research agency called DARPA, which helped bring us everything from the Internet to GPS. Well, I’m going to be proposing to my friends in Congress that we launch a similar operation at the Department of — at the Department of Health — a new effort called “ARPA-H” — to deliver health breakthroughs to find cures for cancer and other diseases by investing billions of dollars that companies are not willing to do — drug companies are not — don’t have the capacity.  And I know we can do this.  And I know we can find great breakthroughs.  America does big things.  Eleven years ago today, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act — historic achievement that would not have been possible but for the vision and determination of one of the most successful Presidents in recent American history: Barack Obama.  I might note, parenthetically, when I got in the automobile to go over to the — to the — to HHS, he was laughing.  I didn’t know what he was laughing about.  And he said, “Did you hear?  They picked up what you said on the mic.”  All I could think was, “Thank God my mother wasn’t around to hear it.”  (Laughter.) But, look, on this anniversary, we should remember just how close we have come to losing that act we so fought so hard for.  And we have a duty not just to protect it, but to make it better and keep becoming a nation where healthcare is a right for all and not a privilege for a few. When I ran for pro- — for President, I promised I would build on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act.  And just 50 days into my administration, we’ve delivered on that promise with the American Rescue Plan.  It does that by making healthcare more affordable.  It means better coverage and lower premiums for millions of Americans. If you’re enrolled in Obamacare, you’re going to save an average of $50 a month — $600 a year — by the reduction of payments.  For a family of four earning $90,000 a year, that could save you $200 a month in savings.  For a 60-year-old couple here in Ohio earning $75,000 per year, it could save them about $1,000 per month and to maintain the same healthcare.  That’s $12,000 a year in your pocket that you didn’t have before. Because of the American Rescue Plan, if you lost healthcare because you lost your job or your hours were cut, we pay your contribution and your employer’s contribution under the so-called COBRA.  That’s what your employer-based health insurance was.  And so since — if they’ve gone out of business or you’re no longer there because you had to be laid off, you can stay covered for up to six months until you get back on your feet, because, look, the federal government will cover both ends of that COBRA payment. For millions who are out of work and have no coverage, thanks to this law, there’s an Obamacare plan that most folks can get with zero-dollar premiums.  Co-pays will still be there, but zero-dollar premiums. Four out of five Americans shopping on the Obamacare marketplace can get quality healthcare with a premium of $10 a month or less.  Let me say that again: Four out of five Americans who shop for a plan will find one for $10 or less per month.  It’s especially important in communities that historically have gone without insurance at higher rates.  Very few communities that have always faced health disparities — Black, Brown, and Asian, Native American communities — have borne the brunt of the COVID crisis. And we’re also making it easy to — easier to sign up for Obamacare.  We’ve opened Healthcare.gov for special enrollment on February the 15th.  In the first two weeks alone, more than 200,000 Americans gained coverage. Today I’m pleased to announce that we’ve extended that period to run through August the 15th.  Just go to HealthCare.gov or call the national hotline: 1-800-318-2596.  That’s 1-800-318-2596.  A few clicks and a short conversation — that’s all it takes to start seeing these benefits of increased coverage and lower premiums. I’ll close with this: With the American Rescue Plan and the Affordable Care Act, millions of families will be able to sleep a little more soundly at night because they don’t have to worry about losing everything if they get sick.  I, like many of you, grew up in a middle-class — I guess, technically, lower-middle-class — household based on outcome.  We lived in a three-bedroom split-level home with four kids and our grandpop living with us.  And the paper — the walls were paper-thin.  I can remember lying in bed and hearing my dad rolling back and forth, and I could tell there was something wrong.  I remember asking my mom the next morning, “What’s the matter with Dad?”  She said, “Honey, he’s just worried.  We just lost our health insurance.  He no longer has his coverage.” People lying in bed wondering, “My God, what happens?  What happens if, in fact, I get sick?  What happens if I turn and she has breast cancer or I end up with a heart condition?  What happens?”  And God forbid you’re sitting on the edge of a hospital bed with someone you love — like I did with my son, Beau, as he was dying, and all you have to think about is — all they have they have to think about is getting better, not what happens if an insurance company can come in, like they did before Obamacare, and say, “Sorry, you’ve outrun your coverage.”  I used to sit there and think, “My God, what would happen?  What would I do?” That’s the difference.  And we’re going to keep building until every American has that peace of mind and to show that our government can fulfill its most essential purpose: to care for and protect the American people.  When we work together, we can do big things, important things, necessary things.  We saw it 11 years ago with the Affordable Care Act.  We saw it 11 days ago when we marked the signing of the American Rescue Plan.  But we’re not done yet. Last week, we met my goal that I announced of administering 100 million shots in my first 100 days in office.  At the time, the press said that’s awfully “audacious.”  Now that we’ve done it in 58 days, they’re saying, “Boy, he sure set the bar awful low.”  Well, this week, we’re announcing a new goal: to get more people vaccinated.  But we need all Americans to keep washing your hands, staying socially distanced, and wearing the mask when you’re in public, as recommended by the CDC.  And get vaccinated when it’s your turn.  It’s a patriotic responsibility you have. Now is not the time to let down our guard.  If we all do our part, after a long, dark year, we can show once again that we are the United States of America; that there’s nothing we have — cannot do if we do it together. We’re going to beat this pandemic.  And because of the great docs up this staircase here, we’re going to beat cancer as we know it as well.  We’re going to make sure, once and for all, that healthcare is a right, not a privilege, in this nation. So I want to say to, again, the docs who spent the day with me, all the incredible work you’re doing — I told them that when my son contracted stage four glioblastoma when coming home from Iraq — when he was in Iraq, that I had the opportunity — the President asked me to do what they called a Cancer Moonshoot.  I put together an organization made up of seven Nobel laureates, as well as another 30 docs in the cancer field, and I was able to go and visit every major cancer facility in the world save one.  And we have some of the finest minds in the world, and they’re right here — right here at Ohio State — Ohio State.  Right here in Ohio, right here in the United States of America.  And they break their necks every single day for us.  We owe them. I want to thank you all.  May God bless you.  May God bless us all and may God protect our troops.  Thank you.  Thank you for the hospitality.  (Applause.) 5:42 P.M.

							 Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research InstituteColumbus, Ohio 3:49 P.M. EDTQ    Sir, is it comforting or is it hopeful or more painful for you to hear about cancer developments like this?THE PRESIDENT:  It’s — it’s mostly hopeful because I don’t want to see anybody go through what my son went through.One of the things you should be aware of: There are probably more soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines coming home with brain cancers than any time in American history because of exposure.  Some of you have read about the burn pits.  There’s a lot of research that still has to be done to determine whether or not exposure to these toxins in the air have something to do with it.  Also, you have an awful lot of these IEDs have caused brain trauma in other ways as well. So, it really is something that I think is going to encourage us to spend a lot more time in the government focusing on.  A little bit like, you know, what used to have to — with Agent Orange: You’d have to prove that, even though you were drenched in it and it rained on you, that whatever your problem was was a consequence of that.  It was very hard to prove.  I finally got a bill passed, as a senator, saying, if you were drenched, you’re automatically assumed — whatever your problem is, related to that. Same thing now with an IED.  If you were near a concussion, you have a problem with — it’s assumed the government has responsibility for it.  And — but there’s a lot going on, and the Doc could tell you more. But one of things that really excites me, Doc, is the idea that we’re moving into potential immunotherapy initiatives that — what they did with Beau, they injected an adenovirus into the brain. DR. ARNAB:  Exactly.THE PRESIDENT:  And it — they were — they were giddy, initially, at all of the — the human body coming in to eat up the virus, but it just kept going.  And because there had been some damage from radiation on a blood vessel, it — things got — it didn’t work. But there’s real hope for people.  There’s real hope.DR. ARNAB:  And, Mr. President, with this FLASH therapy, there’s more — much more synergism with immune therapy than with conventional radiation —THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I agree with that.DR. ARNAB:  — we’re finding.THE PRESIDENT:  Not that I agree.  I don’t mean like — as if I — matters what I agree on. DR. ARNAB:  And our Proton Center, which will be — will treat our first patient 2023 — will have FLASH capabilities.  So it will combine the benefits of protons, FLASH, and immunotherapy together.  So —THE PRESIDENT:  Explain the difference between a proton and radiation going —DR. ARNAB:  Yes, great question.  Great question. THE PRESIDENT:  It’s really important.DR. ARNAB:  Yes.  So with conventional radiation therapy, like this unit right behind you, sir, this produces high-level X-ray energy radiation that’s penetrative.  It goes through normal tissues as well as tumor.  So everything is treated: normal tissues and tumor together. With proton therapy, the dose stops right at the tumor so you’re not treating normal tissues.  So it’s a major advancement in the treatment of cancers.THE PRESIDENT:  Treating normal tissue sometimes is a very bad thing.  Just — it also — it can destroy a normal tissue.  It can destroy the cancer — hit that — but it goes through the cancer and destroys whatever is beyond it.  Not just in the brain, but wherever it —And so that’s why I — I think some of the — a few of the Nobel laureates on my cancer facility are — would argue that we should get — we should start to focus on protons. DR. ARNAB:  Yes. THE PRESIDENT:  And because it doesn’t have the same application, but it does less damage when it occurs — when there is damage done.And — but it really is one of my regrets of becoming President: I had to give up the Biden Cancer Initiative because I couldn’t raise any money for it.  But we proposed — there’s literally six Nobel laureates on the board.  A group — a group of people that are like the Doc.  I tried — I almost called you to ask for you — it’s a long story but —And — but it is something that there’s a lot — these guys are on the edge of so many things.  Think about it: Jimmy Carter was declared basically gone five times.  Now, he’s in trouble now, but it’s amazing that — you know, it’s a little bit like — it’s why you should never give up hope.  When the breakthrough comes, it just comes through.  Not planned — it’s just, “Woah, we got it.”Anyway.  I’m talking too much.Q    Mr. President, do you believe you have the political capital to make changes on gun measures right now?THE PRESIDENT:  I hope so.  I don’t know.  I haven’t done any counting yet. 3:54 P.M.

EDT     THE PRESIDENT:  There’s still a great deal we don’t know about the killer and the motivation of the killer in Boulder, Colorado, and other critical aspects of this mass shooting.  I’ve been briefed this morning by the Attorney General of the United States, the Director of the FBI.  I’ve spoken with the governor, and I’ll be speaking with the mayor on the aircraft.We’re working very closely with the state and local law enforcement officials, and they’re going to keep me updated as they learn more.  You’re going to ask me to speculate — understandably, you’re going to ask me to speculate on what happened, why it happened.  And I’m not going to do that now because we don’t have all the information — not until I have all the facts.But I do know this: As President, I can use all the resources at my disposal to keep the American people safe.  As I said: At this moment, a great deal remains unknown.  But three things are certain.  First, 10 lives have been lost, and more families have been shattered by gun violence in the state of Colorado.  And Jill and I are devastated.  And the feeling — I just can’t imagine how the families are feeling — the victims whose futures were stolen from them, from their families, from their loved ones who now have to struggle to go on and try to make sense of what’s happened.Less than a week after the horrific murders of eight people and the assault on the AAPI community in Georgia, while the flag was still flying half-staff for the tragedy, another American city has been scarred by gun violence and the resulting trauma.And the state that — I even hate to say it because we’re saying it so often: My heart goes out.  Our hearts go out for the survivors.  The — who had to — had to flee for their lives and who hid, terrified, unsure if they would ever see their families again, their friends again.  The consequences of all this are deeper than I suspect we know.  By that, I mean the mental consequences — a feeling of — anyway, it just — we’ve been through too many of these.The second point I want to make is: My deepest thanks to the heroic police and other first responders who acted so quickly to address the situation and keep the members of their community safe.  To state the obviously — the obvious, I commend the exceptional bravery of Officer Eric Talley.  I send my deepest condolences to his family — his close, close family and seven children.You know, when he pinned on that badge yesterday morning, he didn’t know what the day would bring.  I want everybody to think about this: Every time an officer walks out of his or her home and pins that badge on, a family member that they just said goodbye to wonders whether they’ll — subconsciously — will they get that call.  The call that his wife got. He thought he’d be coming home to his family and his seven children.  But when the moment to act came, Officer Talley did not hesitate in his duty, making the ultimate sacrifice in his effort to save lives.  That’s a definition of an American hero.And thirdly, I want to be very clear — this is the one thing I do know enough to say on it, in terms of what’s happened there: While we’re still waiting for more information regarding the shooter; his motive; the weapons he used — the guns, the magazines, the weapons, and the modifications that apparently have taken place to those weapons that are involved here — I don’t need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take commonsense steps that will save the lives in the future and to urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act. We can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again.  I got that done when I was a senator.  It passed.  It was law for the longest time, and it brought down these mass killings.  We should do it again. We can close the loopholes in our background check system, including the “Charleston loophole.”  That’s one of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence.  The Senate should immediately pass — let me say it again: The United States Senate — I hope some are listening — should immediately pass the two House-passed bills that close loopholes in the background check system.  These are bills that received votes of both Republicans and Democrats in the House.  This is not and should not be a partisan issue; this is an American issue.  It will save lives — American lives — and we have to act.  We should also ban assault weapons in the process.I’ll have much more to say as we learn more, but I wanted to be clear: Those poor folks who died left behind families — that leaves a big hole in their hearts.  And — and we can save lives increasing the background checks so that they’re supposed to occur, and eliminating assault weapons and the size of magazines.  We don’t know all the detail yet on that.  But I’ll be talking to you more later today or in the next couple of days about what else we know.May God bless you all and those families who are mourning today because of gun violence in Colorado and Georgia and all across the country.  We have to act so there’s not more of you — there’s fewer of you, as time goes on. Thank you so much.Q    Will you introduce new gun legislation, Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll talk to you about that later.  Thank you.1:02 P.M. EDT We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

THE PRESIDENT:  I know what’s going on in those facilities. Q    Why do you think the message to the migrants, telling them to stay home and don’t come now — why do you think that hasn’t resonated yet?  What more can be done, sir? THE PRESIDENT:  A lot more.  We’re in the process of doing it now, including making sure that we reestablish what existed before, which was they can stay in place and make their case from their home country. Thank you.

							 Emory UniversityAtlanta, Georgia 5:54 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Good afternoon.  Sorry we’re a little late, but we had an opportunity to meet with leaders of the AAPI community downstairs, and it was heart wrenching to listen to them. As many of you know, we originally planned to hold a car rally to thank our supporters.  But given the recent days –events of recent days, we didn’t feel it was appropriate, so we cancelled that rally.  But we want our supporters to know we’ll come back and hold that rally another trip.  But today, we want to speak about something else.I said from the beginning of my campaign for President that we needed to come together; that we needed to unite as one people, one nation, one America.  I said in my kickoff speech in Philadelphia.  I said that very same thing when I spoke at Gettysburg.  I said that in my inaugural address.  And I believe it with every fiber of my being.There are simply some core values and beliefs that should bring us together as Americans.  One of them is standing together against hate, against racism — the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our nation. The Vice President and I, as I said, met a little bit earlier, just before this, with leaders from the Asian American community here in Georgia. We talked about Tuesday’s mass shooting, about another example of public health crisis, of gun violence in this country.  Eight people killed, seven women.   Six were of Asian descent.  All fellow Americans.  Each one of them we mourn.Their families are left with broken hearts and unanswered questions.  And the investigation is ongoing.  And the Vice President and I are being regularly updated by the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, working closely with Governor Kemp and Mayor Bottoms and local officials. But whatever the motivation, we know this: Too many Asian Americans have been walking up and down the streets and worrying, waking up each morning the past year feeling their safety and the safety of their loved ones are at stake.  They’ve been attacked, blamed, scapegoated, and harassed.  They’ve been verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed. Documented incidents against — of hate against Asian Americans have seen a skyrocketing spike over the last year, let alone the ones that happened and never get reported.  It’s been a year of living in fear for their lives just to walk down the street.  Grandparents leave — to leave — afraid to leave their homes.  Small-business owners targeted and gunned down.  Attacks on some of the most vulnerable people in our nation — the elderly, low-wage workers, and women. In fact, Asian American women suffer twice as many incidents of harassment and violence as Asian American men.  We’re learning again what we’ve always known: Words have consequences.  It’s the coro- — it’s the coronavirus.  Full stop. The conversation we had today with the AAPI leaders, and that we’re hearing all across the country, is that hate and violence often hide in plain sight.  And it’s often met with silence.  That’s been true throughout our history, but that has to change — because our silence is complicity.  We cannot be complicit.  We have to speak out.  We have to act. In my first week in office, I signed an executive order directing federal agencies to combat this resurgence of xenophobia.  The Department of Justice is strengthening its partnership with the AAPI community to prevent these crimes, in addition to its other work to take on violent extremism and domestic terrorism. I’m calling on Congress to pass and get my — to get to my desk the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act.  And the House just passed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, a law I authored more than 25 years ago and is one of my proudest legislative achievements.  I call on the Senate to swiftly pass it and get it to my desk. But for all the good that laws can do, we have to change our hearts.  Hate can have no safe harbor in America.  It must stop.  And it’s on all of us — all of us, together — to make it stop.Something else should bring us together, and that is a belief in science.  Science isn’t something that should divide us.  There’s nothing political about it.  There’s nothing partisan about it. One of America’s best examples of commitment to science is headquartered right here in Atlanta: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The CDC represent the best of this nation: brilliant minds, deep faith in science, and a strong commitment to public service.  We came here to thank them for all the work they do, and especially the work they’ve done over the course of this pandemic.  We owe them and their families our gratitude. And we wanted to convey to them the absolute commitment to give them everything they need to do their work and get it done — free of politics and guided by science.  And because of them, we’re making real progress.  We just met my goal of administering 100 million shots before my first 100 days in office.  We did it in about 60 days.  We’re not stopping now. The American Rescue funds more vaccines, more vaccination centers, and more increases in testing.  It’s going to help us accelerate our nationwide effort to reopen schools safely. Last week, I directed all states, Tribes, and territories to make all adults eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1.  But while this is a time of optimism, it’s not a time for relaxation.  I need all Americans to keep doing your part: wash your hands, stay socially distanced, keep masking up as recommended by the CDC, and get vaccinated when it’s your turn.None of this is political.  It’s all science-based.  But now is not the time to let down our guard down.  That’s science-based as well. In the last week, we’ve seen — we’ve seen increases in the number of cases in several states.  Things may get worse as new variants of the virus spread.  That’s why we need to vaccinate as many people as quickly as we possibly can, because it’s the best thing we can do to fight back against these variants.  We will do — we have to beat this virus.  We have to, and we will.  But we’ll do it by setting aside politics and embracing science. On another subject, the right to vote — that should bring us together as well, but it now divides us.  This is a democracy, and the right to vote is fundamental.  The fact that there was a record turnout in America in the last election, in the midst of a pandemic, should be something we celebrated, not attacked. The fact that you held a free and fair election in Georgia that stood up to recount after recount, court case after court case, is something you should be proud of. The fact that your poll workers, your election workers, your volunteers, your local officials, your state officials, your courts stood up to the immense pressure with character and honesty and integrity helped save our democracy.  And this country will long be grateful for it. But as this state, home to Martin Luther King and John Lewis, knows better than most: The battle for the right to vote is never, ever over.  And it’s not over here, in this state of Georgia. So we’re in the fight again.  It’s a fight we need to win.  Because if anyone ever doubted that voting matters, Georgia just proved it did.  If anyone ever wondered if one vote can make a difference, Georgia just proved it 11,779 times.  And if anyone ever wondered if voting can change a country, Georgia just proved it can.  Because when you elected two new United States senators, you made it possible to pass the American Rescue Plan. Landmark legislation will not only meet the emergency we’re in, but transform this nation — starting with this: For those folks who either already have or will soon have $1,400 in their pockets, you can thank Senators Warnock and Ossoff.  But for their votes, it would not have happened. What does that mean?  It means 85 percent of the households in America will get that money.  Here in Georgia, it means 88 percent of all adults and 88 percent of the children in this state will get that $1,400 as well.  Just add it up.  A typical family — two parents, two kids — earning $100,000 a year, each will get $1,400.  That’s $5,600 for that family that’s in distress trying to figure out how to pay their mortgage, pay their rent, keep food on the table. And that’s not all.  There’s something called a “child tax credit.”  What that basically means is you get a tax credit for every child you have.  The American Rescue Plan expands that credit.  It means that families of over 2 million children in Georgia will be eligible for an increase in that child tax credit of [up to] $1,600 per year [sic] — per child.  And it’s going to be delivered on a regular basis. So, starting this summer, families with young kids will get $300 a month per child.  This is going to lift 177,000 [171,000] children in Georgia out of poverty.The American Rescue Plan expands coverage and reduces costs under the Affordable Care Act.  So for a family of four earning $90,000 per year, with insurance under the Affordable Care Act, they’ll see about $200 a month off their monthly premiums. And for Georgia’s schools, the American Rescue Plan provides around $4 billion for Georgia’s schoolchildren, grades K through 12, to help them reopen safely. And here’s one of the biggest things for Georgia: Because of the American Rescue Plan, Georgia is now eligible for about $2 billion to expand Medicaid.  What does that mean?  It means another 500,000 Georgians will be covered all across this state with Medicaid that don’t have it now. For your state and local governments, this is what it does: State government will get around $5 billion to make up for lost revenue.  Local governments will get around $3.5 billion.  That’s going to make it possible to keep a lot of police officers, firefighters, teachers, and other first responders on the job. And here’s one final thing the American Rescue Plan does: For the first time in a long time, it puts the working families, the middle class — people who built this country — first, not last.Sixty-six percent of the tax breaks in this plan go to folks making $90,000 or less a year.  And how much for the top 1 percent — where 83 percent of all of the tax cut — it was the last President’s tax cut?  Zero.  The top 1 percent get zero. But the American Rescue Plan isn’t only about putting money in the pockets — people’s pockets.  It also will create and spur economic growth in America.  That’s why major economists — left, right, and center — support this plan.  Even Wall Street agrees.  According to Moody’s, this law will help America create 7 million new jobs by the end of the year.  And we’ll do it by rebuilding the backbone of this nation: the working people, the middle class — the people who built this country.  It’s about giving those people a fair shot, for a change. It’s about providing and proving to the American people that their government works and can deliver for them, which brings me to my last point. The American Rescue Plan is a plan that brings America together and benefits all America.  That’s why so many polls show that over 70 percent of the country support it, including Democrats, Republicans, and independents.  Maybe Republicans in Washington didn’t vote for it, but the American Rescue Plan sure has brought the country together.  And, for me, that measure of unity, that’s what matters.Let me end with this: There is so much we can do if we do it together; if we remember who we are; if we stand together against hate; once again believe and invest in science; if we stand up for the right of all Americans to vote and have access to voting; if we remember we’re here to help all the people of this country, not just those few at the top; if we remember to do justice, love mercy, to walk humbly as fellow human beings and as fellow Americans; if we remember we’re the United States of America and that, together, there is nothing — not a single thing — we cannot do if we do it together. My heart goes out to all — all the family members who lost someone in those horrific shootings on Tuesday.  I know they feel that — like there’s a black hole in their chest they’re being sucked into and things will never get better.  But our prayers are with you.  And I assure you the one you’ve lost will always be with you.  Always be with you.  And the day will come when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye, as unbelievable as that is now.  It will take a while, but I promise you it will come.  And when it does, that’s the day you know you’re going to make it.   May God bless all those families.  May God protect our troops.  Thank you very much.6:10 P.M.

							 Centers for Disease Control and PreventionAtlanta, Georgia 2:17 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:  You know, one of the things that caught my attention — and I think we talked about this very early on, within the first six weeks of the virus becoming where it — everybody, and people starting to get sick, and some of them die.  And — was I got a call from a mayor — a really great guy, a real hardworking fellow in Detroit — saying to me, “Mr. President, you don’t understand.”  This was even before — I wasn’t President then, actually.  He called me, “Mr. Vice President.”  He said, “You know, I don’t think people understand.  You know, my community is now about 80 percent African American.  And we’re dying and getting sick at a much higher rate than the white community here, or any other community.” And I brought that up, initially, before I put together that group that you’re leading and helping lead, and no one wanted to hear it.  And I remember they — we had trouble getting your predecessors to track it.  But what you’re doing really makes a difference.  It makes a gigantic difference.  As the Vice President knows as well or better than anybody, it really, really makes a difference.  So, thank you.  DR. LIBURD:  Thank you.  Dr. Walensky?  Thank you so much. DR. WALENSKY:  Any other questions for us? THE PRESIDENT:  No, but why are y’all standing?  (Laughter.) That’s the first one.  You don’t have to stand for us.  Why don’t you sit down?  For real.  Get comfortable.  PARTICIPANT:  No chair. THE PRESIDENT:  No, they have chairs.  They have chairs.  (Laughter.)  But, you know, that’s — that’s the first question. And the second question is, why did only one person clap?  I don’t know.  They might take that (inaudible).  You know what I mean?  (Laughter.)  I’m teasing.  I’m teasing.  (Applause.)  The reason I do this, as the Doc knows — you all are too serious here — we owe you a gigantic debt of gratitude, and we will for a long, long, long time, because I hope this is the beginning of the end of not paying attention to what’s going to come again and again and again and again.  We can build all the walls we want.  We can have the most powerful armies in the world, but we can’t — but we cannot stop — we cannot stop these viruses, other than be aware of where they are and move quickly on them when we find them.  And the one thing that I — the reason I am so, so happy to have been able to — anyway — to have Doc here is that science is back.  No, all kidding aside.  Think about it: For the longest time, not just — not just as it relates to CDC, but science — science was viewed as — as sort of an appendage to anything else we were talking about.  But it’s back. And I just want you to have some confidence that it’s not only — are the Vice President and I and the whole team, and the whole COVID team writ-large committed, but the American people have moved.  The American people have moved. This is a bipartisan effort now.  Now, it isn’t showing itself in the way senators and congressmen vote, but the public — the public.  We were talking about it on a — on a helicop- — on the airplane.  The public, in a bipartisan way.  When I came up with this $1.9 billion for this whole COVID — and the economic relief side of it as well — we were told that it could never pass; we’d never get any help.  Well, we didn’t get any help in the Senate or the House, but you have 55 percent of the Republicans in America supporting it.  You have 90-some percent of the Democrats, 80-some — The point is, the public is thankful to you, because it’s about science.  That’s what they understand.  They understand.  And we’re not going back to the old days.  Even if tomorrow the whole administration changed, I think things have — you’ve changed things.  You’ve changed them in a way that are going to make everybody healthier in this country.  And when we have a crisis, you’re prepared to meet it because you speak truth and science to power, and that is — that is the power. So, to all of the folks listening — I guess you said there’s hundreds or if not thousands of people listening: DR. WALKE:  Yes. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There’s an entire generation coming up that is learning from what you’ve done.  I don’t just mean learning about how to deal with a virus.  Learning about it makes a difference to tell the truth, to follow the science, and just wherever it takes you, and just be honest about it.  And that’s what you’ve all done.  So we owe you a debt of gratitude in all the lives you’ve saved.  I carry in my pocket — and the Doc knows — on the back of my schedule, I have listed every single day with the exact number of people who have died from COVID the day before.  I mean for cumulative.  We’re at 535,217 dead as of yesterday, last night. It’s got to stop.  But you’re slowing it.  It’s stopping. And it really, really matters.  You know, that’s more people than have died in all of World War — Americans — all of World War One, World War Two, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined — combined — in a year.  In a year.  And you are the Army.  You’re the Navy.  You’re the Marines.  You’re the Coast Guard.  I really mean it.  This is a war.  You are the frontline troops.  It sounds silly to say it that way.  It sounds sort of grand.  But think about it. And, finally, we got the vaccines.  We got the companies together.  And then they didn’t have the wherewithal to be able to produce all the vaccines. So there’s a thing called the Defense Production Act.  As President, I’m allowed to enforce it.  So I had people saying, “Stop making that, and start making these.” We finally put together — did you ever think you’d see the day — because you’ve all been involved with medicine — see two major drug companies cooperate for the good of the country?  One invent — one come up with the drug, and the other say, “Well, we’ll manufacture it for you”? So what — what you’re doing really, really, really matters, not only — and I’ll end with this — not only in saving lives, but changing the mindset of the country.  Changing the mindset of the country.  And it’s affected everything, not just affected people’s health.  It’s affected their attitude — the attitude about what we can do as a country. Everybody thought that I was — I didn’t quite understand when I announced that we were going to — we had over 100 million shots in less than — you remember when I said we’re going to — my goal was to have 100 million shots in people’s arms in the first 100 days as President?  And everybody said, “Oh, that sounds — yeah, right.”  Now it’s, “He should have been more — have been, you know…”  (Laughter.)  “Why didn’t they say more?”  You know what I mean?  But here’s the point: The point is that it is changing the way we look at a whole range of things.  And when I announced it, everybody but the Vice President wondered why I also pointed out that we landed a rover on Mars at the same time: Because this is the United States of America, for God’s sake.  There is nothing, nothing, nothing we cannot do when we do it together.  And that’s what you’re showing everybody. So I came to say thank you.  I really mean it.  I have a whole lot of nice notes on here about the science, but — (laughter) — but I came here to say thank you, because you’re not only — you’re changing the psyche of the country.  You’re saving lives.  You’re saving lives.  But you’re changing the psyche of the country. And this is, as I said — it’s not being — I don’t — I don’t think we’re being chauvinistic about our country, but this is — think about it: We’re the only country in the world that has, every time we’ve gone into a crisis, have come out stronger immediately after the crisis than when we went in before the crisis.  Think about it.  It’s about who we are.  Closing comment: I was with Xi Jinping — China.  I spent more time with him, I’m told, than any world leader — because when he was Vice President, I was Vice President. His President and mine wanted us to get to know one another because it was clear he was going to become the President.  And I spent — traveled 17,000 miles with him in China, in the United States, and Asia generally, and met with him, I guess, they tell me, 24, 25 hours alone, just me and an interpreter, and he and an interpreter.  And, by the way, I handed in all my notes.  (Laughter.)  Minor point. But all kidding aside, he asked me — we were on the Tibetan Plateau.  He asked me and said to me, “Can you define America for me?”  And I said, “Yeah, in one word.  And I mean it — in one word: possibilities.”  Possibilities.  That’s what you guys believe in: possibilities, based on science and hard data. And so I just thank you for not only your intellectual skills, but your heart — your heart, your determination.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  And I shouldn’t have done that because I wanted to yield to my Vice President, who’s smarter than I am. THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, there’s not much to add to that, Mr. President.  (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, just sorry. THE VICE PRESIDENT:  No, I — but I will say that I do believe that this administration, with the leadership of our President, is without any question about science.  And everyone here knows, before the President was President, he was dedicated to science — the Moonshot.  And so — and my mother was a scientist.  I grew up — the first job I had — little-known fact — was cleaning pipettes at her lab.  I was awful.  She fired me.  (Laughter.)  And then there was this moment of global crisis.  And the President takes calls with leaders around the world.  We talk with people around the world.  And they have named their centers of disease control after this center of disease control.  They put their — the name of their country, and they call it “CDC.”  You all are a model for the world around what can be done based on a pursuit of that which will uplift and improve human condition and life.  And you guys do this work around the clock.  And so we are here to say thank you — because it’s not easy.  You’re making difficult decisions right now, some of the most difficult, but you’re making those decisions based on science, based on hard work, and based on a commitment to the public health.  And therein lies part of the nobility of your work.  You do this work on behalf of people you will never meet, on behalf of people who will never know your names because you care about our country and their wellbeing.  So we are here to thank you.  Thank you. 2:29 P.M.

							 East Room 3:26 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:  Well, folks, good to see you all.  When I announced in early December that I had goal that I set of administering 100 million shots for the virus in the first 100 days of our office — 100 million shots in 100 days — it was considered ambitious.  Some even suggested it was somewhat audacious.  Experts said that it was a — the plan was, quote, “definitely aggressive,” and distribution would have to be “seamless” for us to be successful.  One headline simply put it, quote: “It won’t be easy.”  End of quote.  Well, it wasn’t. When I took office, when we took office, there was a lot that had to be done.  We needed more vaccines, more vaccinators, more places for people to get vaccinated.  And we needed a whole-of-government approach.  So, I directed Jeff Zients, the coordinator of our COVID-19 response, to put us on a war footing — and I meant that in a literal sense — to get us on track to truly beat this virus. And I’m proud to announce that tomorrow, 58 days into our administration, we will have met my goal of administering 100 million shots to our fellow Americans.  That’s weeks ahead of schedule, and even with the setbacks we faced during the winter storms.  And it’s another big step on the path to checking the — putting checks in pockets and shots in people’s arms.  When we crossed the 50 million doses just three weeks ago,   I told you that every time we hit the 50 million mark, I’d update you on our progress.  So here is where we are today: Eight weeks ago, only 8 percent of seniors, those most vulnerable to COVID-19, had received a vaccination.  Today, 65 percent of people aged 65 or older have received at least one shot, and 36 percent are fully vaccinated.  And that’s key — because this is a population that represents 80 percent of the well over 500,000 COVID-19 deaths that have occurred in America. We have nearly doubled the amount of vaccine doses that we distribute to states, Tribes, and territories each week.  We have gone from 1 million shots a day — that I promised in December, before we were even sworn in — to an average of two and one half million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world significantly. And here’s how we accomplished this: Using the power given to a President under the Defense Production Act, we expedited critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies.  We worked with vaccine manufacturers to speed up the delivery of millions more doses and brokered a historic manufacturing partnership between competing companies who put patriotism and public health first. These steps put us on track to have enough vaccine — enough vaccine supply for every adult American by the end of May — months — months earlier than anyone expected. And we stood up or supplied more than 600 community vaccination sites that are administering hundreds of thousands of shots per day.  We launched the Federal Pharmacy Program, which has allowed millions of Americans to get a shot at one of one thous- — or, excuse me, one of 14,000 local pharmacies in this country, the same way they get their flu shot.  And for folks who aren’t near a pharmacy or mass vaccination center, we’ve supplied more than 500 mobile clinics, like pop-up sites or vans, meeting people where they are — meeting people where they are. We’ve developed nearly — we’ve deployed nearly 6,000 federal personnel, including FEMA, active-duty military, and  Department of Health and Human Services to support vaccinations and serve as vaccinators — putting the needle in people’s arms. We’re also supplying vaccines to community health centers to reach those who have been the hardest hit — the hardest hit — and suffered the most, especially Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities.  This is really important — because we believe that speed and efficiency must be matched with fairness and equity.    Now, when [Vice] President Harris and I took a virtual tour of a vaccination center in Arizona not long ago, one of the nurses on that — on that tour, injecting people, giving vaccinations, said that each shot was like administering a dose of hope.  “A dose of hope.”  That’s how she phrased it. Behind these 100 million shots are millions of lives changed when people receive that dose of hope: Grandparents can hug their grandchildren again.  Frontline workers who can show up at their jobs without the same fear they used to have.  Teachers — with the confidence to head back into the classroom. These milestones are significant accomplishments, but we have much more to do.  Much more to do.  And the American Rescue Plan will help us do it. In addition to the cash payments it provides to you and your families, it also provides the funds to add vaccinators, to supply [sic] more community vaccination — support more community vaccination centers, and increase testing. It will help us accelerate nationwide efforts to reopen our schools safely.  And as I told the nation last week, I’ve directed all states, Tribes, and territories to make all adults eligible to be vaccinated no later than May the 1st.  I’m glad to see that several states are already taking that step to make more and more Americans eligible, even before May 1st. Tomorrow, we will hit 100 million doses our administration has administered.  But I’ve always said: That’s just the floor.  We will not stop until we beat this pandemic.  Next week, I will announce our next goal to put shots in arms.  This is a time for optimism, but it’s not a time for relaxation.  I need all Americans — I need all of you to do your part: Wash your hands, stay socially distanced, keep masking up as recommended by the CDC, and get vaccinated when it’s your turn.  Now is not the time to let down our guard. In the last week, we’ve seen increases in the number of cases in several states. Scientists have made clear that things may get worse as new variants of this virus spread.  Getting vaccinated is the best thing we can do to fight back against these variants.   While millions of people are vaccinated, we need millions more to be vaccinated.  And, again, I need you to get vaccinated when it come– when it’s your turn, when you’re able to do that.  I need your help.  I need you to help — not just the country, but your family, your friends, your neighbors.  Get them vaccinated as well. If we keep our guard up, stick together, and stick with the science, we can look forward to a Fourth of July that feels a bit more normal, with small groups able to gather for cookouts in backyards, and when we’ll be — where we begin to declare our independence on Independence Day from the virus.  Look, together — together we’re going to come through this stronger, with renewed faith in each other, in our government that fulfills its most important function: protecting the American people. Let me be clear again: wearing this mask, in the meantime; making sure you wash your hands; making sure you socially distance and listen to the CDC.  We’ve got to reach the point where we have herd immunity — meaning where we have a vast majority of the American people have been vaccinated — before we can stop wearing these.  So, please, please, don’t let what’s happening — you see happening in Europe and you see on television.  Keep the faith.  Keep wearing the mask, keep washing your hands, and keep socially distanced.  We’re going to beat this.  We’re way ahead of schedule, but we’ve got a long way to go.  So I just wanted to bring you up to date.  And I thank you very much.  And may God bless America, and may God protect our troops.  Thank you so much.                                          END                 3:36 P.M.

							 Via TeleconferenceOval Office 1:20 P.M. EDTPRESIDENT BIDEN:  I’m going to make a brief opening statement about a current thing going on in the United States here, and that is the shooting down in Atlanta where eight people were killed and — seven women, six of Asian American background.And I was just, on the telephone, briefed by the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of the FBI.  And the investigation is ongoing and the question of motivation is still to be determined.But whatever the motivation here, I know that Asian Americans are in very — very concerned because, as you know, I’ve been speaking about the brutality against Asian Americans for the last couple months, and I think it’s a — it is very, very troublesome.And — but I’m making no connection at this moment for the motivation of what the — of the killer.  I’m waiting for an answer from — as the investigation proceeds, from the FBI and from the Justice Department.  So — and that’s — so I’ll have more to say when the investigation is completed.Now, I want to say Happy St. Patrick’s Day to the Taoiseach.  (Laughs.)  It’s good to — it’s good to have you on television.  But next year, in Washington — next year, in Washington — for years, as you know, Taoiseach, we — we celebrated this — this St. Patrick’s Day.  I always put on a breakfast at my home, and — at the Vice President’s Residence — with leading Irish Americans, your ambassador, our ambassador, as well as some of the prelates who were involved with this.  And it was always a good time. Then we’d go into this very office.  You’d sit in the chair over here — the Taoiseach would sit there.  And I’d sit where — where the — my National Security Advisor is sitting, and we’d have a long discussion with the President.  And then we’d go up to the — up to the United States Capitol where the Speaker of the House, starting with Tip O’Neill, would put on an event as well.  And then I always snuck over to the Irish Embassy later.I hope we can do that next year.  I hope we can do that next year.  And in the meantime, I want to thank you for the shamrock bowl.  I don’t know whether you can see it here, but it’s a great tradition — a custom that goes all the way back to Harry Truman, who — I have a bust of Harry Truman over in that corner.  I noticed he didn’t move to grab any of the — any of the shamrocks, but —And tonight, Taoiseach, I wish you — we hope you’ll be able to see it, at least remotely.  We’re going to light up the — the White House in green.  And we — to celebrate the deep, deep affection that the — we Americans have, particularly Irish Americans have for Ireland and the people of Ireland.  And that includes millions of Americans like my — like my great-great-grandfather and my great-grandfather and my grandfather, all of whom were Irish Americans on both sides of the family.My — my grandfather, Ambrose Finnegan, who was a great football player — American football — and a newspaper man back at the turn of the 19th — of the 20th century, used to always say when — later when he was much older and I’d walk out of his home, he’d say, “Joey, remember: The best drop of blood in you is Irish.”  (Laughs.)  I remembered it, I promise you.  And — because if I didn’t, my grandmother, Geraldine Blewitt Finnegan, would take me down.And we have a lot of great memories as well in our family because one of your predecessors — I went over.  I’ve been to Ireland many times, but the first time I went to actually go back and look at my roots and meet my family was — was back when — the last year we were — I was Vice President of the United States.  And we went both to — to Mayo, where the Blewitts are from, and Ballina, the city; and we went to County Louth, where the Finnegans are from.  And it was a great, great opportunity for me to show my grandchildren and children and my brother and sister.I joked at the time, but I — after I left, I wondered why the hell we left in the first place.  It’s beautiful.  It’s beautiful. And so, I think, you know, there’s a lot of folks here in Ireland — my — my friends from Ireland would always say the American Irish think they’re more Irish than the Irish.  But the truth of the matter is that we have a great affection for the country and a great affection for the tradition.  And we have a — Ireland and United States have a robust agenda that we got to deal with on the substantive side of this — of these issues, Taoiseach, and — from combating COVID, to strengthening global health security, to also discussing our economic cooperation and Ireland’s leadership now in the U.N. Security Council, which we’re working together.  Our U.N. Ambassador is online with us here.  And I just welcome the leadership and your partnership. And you know my view and the view of my predecessor, my — of the Obama-Biden administration on the Good Friday Agreements.  We strongly support them; think it’s critically important that they be maintained.  And the political and economic stability of Northern Ireland is very much in the interest of all our peoples — the people-to-people ties. And I think the idea that we — we talked about, about renewing our partnership and the All-Island Consortium — Cancer Consortium.  The U.S.-Ireland and Northern Ireland — it’s a partnership that’s — that I think we can learn a lot from one another.  It’s one of the things that, as President, Taoiseach, I am going to focus heavily on with our National Institute of Health: on dealing with — with cancer.  We’ve all been victims of it, in terms of our families.  We all know what it’s like.  And we’re going to make major investments in NIH and cancer research and development.  And I’m looking forward to working together. As a matter of fact, my relatives in — in Mayo just dedicated a — my — Laurita, one of my cousins, headed up the hospice effort for cancer — not just cancer, but hospice in — in Ireland.  And they just dedicated a new significant facility to my son Beau Biden, who — who died of cancer. And so, everything between Ireland and the United States runs deep, Taoiseach.  Our — our joys, our sorrows, our passion, our drive, and our unrelenting optimism and hope.One of the few quotes that I’ve been given credit for over my career was, I said — but I mean it — maybe it’s just my family — I said, “We Irish are the only people who are nostalgic for the future.”  (Laughs.)  And I think we are. It’s a — it’s a great — a great opportunity for you and I to get to talk a little bit.  So I’m looking forward to our conversation, and I’m looking forward to getting deeper into discussion about some of the things that are of great mutual interest to both of us.But as we used to say in the United States Senate, Taoiseach, “I yield the floor to you.”PRIME MINISTER MARTIN:  Thank you very much indeed, Mr. President.  I’m quite — first of all, again, on behalf of the Irish people, to you I express my condolences to the people of America and, indeed, to the people of Atlanta and the families of those who were killed and injured in the horrible and very shocking shootings yesterday.  And our solidarity is with you, particularly with the — the Asian American community.  We stand together against such mindless acts of violence.But I know, Mr. President, that St. Patrick’s Day is very special to you as a proud son of Ireland.  Equally, I have to tell you, the people of Ireland are so proud of your election as President of the United States of America.  And I can think of no better day for me to have the great pleasure to extend to you their warmest greetings. PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.PRIME MINISTER MARTIN:  Beannachtaí na Féile Pádraig dhuit.  Happy St. Patrick’s Day.Now, as you said, it seems strange to have to celebrate apart.  As you know well, Irish people love to come together to celebrate our heritage and culture with song, with dance, with parades, with poetry, and with pride. And this year, because of the pandemic, it just simply is impossible.  And here in Ireland, people are make — are marking the occasion in their homes, but they will be thinking especially of their loved ones around the world and sending them best thoughts and wishes.  And they will do so in the hope that next year will be better, as I do believe it will.PRESIDENT BIDEN:  It will.PRIME MINISTER MARTIN:  With each person vaccinated, we move closer to the day when people can meet each other, hug each other, and celebrate again.  And I greatly look forward to you being able to visit Ireland as you have done so many times and, as you have said, so memorably before.  I also hope it will not be long before I can visit the United States again.For now, the bowl of shamrock in front of you is a symbol of the undying friendship between our two countries — a symbol of the good times we have shared and the challenges we’ve endured, always at each other’s side.The green shoots point to the brighter future that I know lies ahead.  And building that brighter future will, of course, be part of what we discuss today.  The policies of our — of our two governments are very closely aligned on the big challenges the world faces.  And I look forward to exploring how we can defeat the COVID-19 virus, working together urgently to increase the supply of vaccine for our own people and for people around the world.We should share notes on our plans to recovery, getting back the ground lost to the pandemic.  Both the United States and Europe have put funds of unprecedented scale in place to support this vital work and to build a stable and inclusive future supporting the digital and green agendas, promoting open and fair rules-based trade, delivering greater equality and opportunity. Mr. President, the world has rightly taken great heart from the steps you have already taken to bring the U.S. back to center stage on global health, on climate, and on human rights.We want to work with you to promote our shared values and interests in the world, including at the United Nations Security Council on which we are, as you said, currently serving.  We want to work with you on time and action, which becomes ever more urgent as we approach COP26 later this year.Today, I especially want to thank you for your unwavering support for the Good Friday Agreement.  It has meant a lot, and it has mattered, including as we negotiated Brexit.  With a new trading relationship now in place between the European Union and the United Kingdom, and a protocol that protects peace and avoids a hard border on this island, I want to move forward with a positive relationship with the United Kingdom.  And that means standing by what has been agreed and working together to make a success of it.  And that, in turn, then can help maintain peace and promote greater reconciliation on our shared island — goals that I know you support.There are so many areas where the Irish and American people are already working together, and we would celebrate some of them here today: a consortium through which our practitioners and researchers would improve their efforts to defeat cancer — that most pernicious disease that I know is very close to your heart in terms of dealing with that; a new initiative to share (inaudible) and bring it to newer and younger audiences that we will announce today.Mr. President, thank you.  I am fundamentally an optimist. We have all endured the most difficult year.  But alongside suffering and the loss, we have seen immense compassion, care, and courage, especially from our head workers, our educators, and our volunteers.  We have seen the world’s best scientists come together to deliver treatments, vaccines, and hope at an extraordinary pace.  And I say that the same spirit of cooperation now will speed and guide our recovery in the year ahead. And thank you, Mr. President.  I look forward to our discussion.PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I look forward to it as well.1:34 P.M.

							 Smith Flooring Inc.Chester, Pennsylvania  3:30 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT:  As I said, this is a great outfit.  This is a union shop.  These are people who work like the devil, and they can make a living wage, a decent wage.  But 300,000 Pennsylvanians lost jobs — 300,000.  And in Delaware County alone — this in 2020 — 19,000.And I’m not being solicitous when I say these are two of the finest congressmen in the United States Congress in terms of getting things done.  I really mean it.  And, you know, the American Rescue Plan is going to do more than just provide for the PPE. And one of the things that we’ve done early on — they passed the CARES Act early on.  And what we did — what they did was they provided for an inspector general — an outfit to look over where the money was going to make sure that it was spent properly.  And the first thing the President did: he came along and he fired the inspector general.  And we found out that only 40 percent of the people who, in fact, were small businesses got in on the deal.  And they got very big businesses getting the lion’s share of that money.So when we wrote this Rescue Plan, they were (inaudible) insistent that we have an inspector general to make sure the money goes exactly where it’s supposed to go.And so we’re in a position where it’s going to bring immediate relief — $1,400 — to 85 percent of the American public.  I said, yesterday, we’re going to get 100 million shots in people’s arms within the first 60 days of my administration and 100 million checks out — 100 million people are going to be getting, not a joke, a check for $1,400, which would change their lives.And you know so many of the people who have worked (inaudible) and gotten themselves laid off or there wasn’t work, and you find yourself, you know, it’s hard paying the rent, hard paying the childcare, hard paying for much of anything. So I just think that — I hope that the program that we’re having here — we’re going to have a tax cut to help retired workers.  We’re in a situation where we’re going to expand the paytech [sic] — paycheck — Paycheck Protection Program for the folks who were initially shut out.Initially, at the very beginning of the Paycheck Protection Program, you’d go to a big bank, they’d say, “Do you have an account with us?  Have you borrowed money from us?  Do you have a credit card from us?”  They didn’t want to deal with people who were on the short side of things.  But you’ve really made it work.  And I think you should be aware: More help is on the way, for real. Do you have questions for me at all? MS. SMITH:  Well, we don’t have any questions, but we did want to say thank you.  Thank you for your being who you are.  Thank you for helping the small business — small minority business.  It means a lot that you’re here in Chester.  It means a lot that you came to see our business because, you know, although Congresswoman Scanlon and Congresswoman Hou- — Houlahan, I’m sorry.  I know Congresswoman Scanlon a little more.  (Laughs.)  I’m sorry.  But not many people come out and stop here in Chester.  And so we’re just grateful.  We’re grateful for the things that you’re doing.THE PRESIDENT:  Every time I got stop — stopped in Chester, I lost.  I went to school in Claymont, just across the line at Archmere Academy.  And we played up here, and you better come prepared to play against Chester.   (Laughter.) MS. SMITH:  That’s true. THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) playing Chester.  So a lot of my buddies are from Chester, for real.  The people I grew up with. And it’s — you know, one of the things that we haven’t — and we’re trying like the devil to make sure to correct is: People who are hardest hit by — and the Congresswoman knows this better than I do — the hardest hit are people in the minority communities.  The rate at which they get COVID is significantly higher sometimes in the Latino community, black community — four times greater — and the death rate is significantly higher.And in the last place — and that’s why we’re working so hard — they’re working so hard to make sure to get the vaccines in places that are not ordinarily the focus.  That’s why we put these vaccines in community health centers.  That’s why we have them in drugstores now.  That’s why we have mobile units. But I’m not — I’m not just saying this because we’re here.  They have been loud and strong voices — “Get this done.”  And it’s not like it passed with 100 votes.  You know what I mean?  It’s — it was close. And I want to thank you both.  And everybody in this county and the next county, in Delaware County, should thank you as well. So is there anything else we can be doing?MS. SMITH:  We just want —THE PRESIDENT:  How many employees at your peak?MR. SMITH:  At our peak, we’re at about 20, 23 people.  Our peak is summertime.  We do a lot of school work, and so that’s when we get our big boost.THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.MR. SMITH:  Right now we’re about 12 — 12 people between people in the office, out in the field. THE PRESIDENT:  I think it’s going to allow you to bring folks back and increase — increase your business.MR. SMITH:  And it’s great that schools got funding, so now the schools are going to do some construction and (inaudible).THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  No, it’s a big deal.  It’s a big deal.Well, you both do a heck of a job. MS.

							 State Dining Room 2:03 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.   When I signed the American Rescue Plan last week, I said, “Help is on the way.”  This week — and I — I can report — this is just — it’s here, sooner than many ever thought possible.  Over the next 10 days, we’ll reach two goals — two giant goals.  The first is, 100 million shots in people’s arms will have been completed within the next 10 days, and 100 million checks in people’s pockets in the next 100 [10] days.  Shots in arms and money in pockets — that’s important.  The American Rescue Plan is already doing what it was designed to do: make a difference in people’s everyday lives.  And we’re just getting started.  By the time all the money is distributed, 85 percent of American households will have gotten a $1,400 rescue checks.  To give more — to give one more example: For the average family of two parents and two children making a combined income of $110,000 a year, that’s going to add $5,600 for them — $5,600 they’ll get.  And the plan does a lot more.  It extends unemployment insurance for the 11 million Americans unemployed and any who will be unemployed in the near term.  It will help hundreds of thousands of small businesses keep their doors open, which makes a gigantic difference in neighborhoods and communities.  If you have a drugstore, if you have a — a beauty shop, a hardware store, it’s the center of small communities.  And it gets our schools and — resources they need to open safely.  It provides the biggest investment in childcare since World War Two.  And it provides food and nutrition help for the millions of families to keep them from going hungry, keeping a roof over their heads.  And it expands healthcare coverage and lowers healthcare costs for so many people.  And it will cut child poverty in half in this country.  That’s the estimate: Child poverty will be cut in half as a consequence of what’s in this recovery act.  And it will generate economic growth for the entire nation.  That’s why major economists — left, right, and center — support this plan.  Even Wall Street has agreed.  According to Moody’s, by the end of this year, this law will spur our economy to create 7 million new jobs.  And it does one more thing: It focuses on rebuilding the backbone of this country — working families, the middle class, the people who built this country.  But as I said last week, it’s one thing to pass a historic piece of legislation like the American Rescue Plan, and it’s quite another to implement it.  And the devil is in the details.  It requires fastidious oversight to make sure the relief arrives quickly, equitably, and efficiently with no waste or fraud in your bank account, in your mailbox, to the local business in your community and to your child’s school.  Look, I’ve been here before.  When President Obama and I came into office in 2009, he put me in charge of implementing the Recovery Act, which helped us recover and rebuild during the Great Recession.  I was authorized to put together a team, including an accountability board with inspectors general from different agencies that were affected by the act to make sure we got the roughly $800 billion out — out and into the countryside, by the book and quickly, over 18 months.  I talked to literally almost 100 — over 150 mayors, all governors except one, constantly going over the granular detail of the implementation of this legislation — that legislation.  And the effort put us on a path from crisis to recovery to resurgence.  Accordingly, to the oversight board that these — of inspectors general — they said we got it done with less than two tenths of 1 percent waste or fraud.  And that’s not what the previous administration did though. When the Congress, last year, passed the CARES Act, the CARES Act — the Congress created a committee of inspectors general to make sure every penny of that money was spent as it was directed.  But one of the first things the previous administration did was fire the head of the inspector general’s committee.  So when Congress passed what was intended to be a small business relief program, it instead became a free-for-all for well-connected companies.  And mainstream — mainstream businesses, from hardware stores to beauty salons, that needed the help most were left behind.  Four hundred thousand are now gone.  We will not let that happen this time.  I learned from my experience implementing the Recovery Act just how important it is to have someone who can manage all the moving parts with efficiency, speed, and integrity, and accountability.  That’s the sort of management we’ve seen in our fight against the virus with Jeff Zients, our COVID Response Coordinator.  And today, I’m pleased to announce and introduce another gifted manager to coordinate our implementation of the American Rescue Plan: Gene Sperling.  Gene will be on the phone with mayors and governors — red states, blue states.  A source of constant communication, a source of guidance and support, and, above all, a source of accountability for all of us to get the job.  Gene has been here before.  The only person in history to serve as director of economic — of the National Economic Council twice.  He led successful efforts to deliver relief to small businesses and unemployed Americans in the Obama-Biden administration and in the Clinton administration.  I spoke with Gene earlier today, alongside my economic team; he’s ready to get to work.  In fact, he’s already hit the ground running.  And together we’re going to make sure that the benefits the American Rescue Plan go out quickly and directly to the American people, where they belong.  Let me close with this: Help is here and hope is here in real and tangible ways.  We’re just days away from 100 million shots in millions — in the arms of millions of Americans.  That’s the way.  That’s the way — on the way to get every single American access to the vaccine.  One hundred million checks going into the pockets — and/or direct deposits — going into the pockets of Americans, on the way to a million more — millions of more Americans.  That’s real progress.  But we have a lot more to do.  We have to prove to the American people that their government can deliver for them, and do it without waste or fraud; that we can vaccinate the nation; that we can get our kids safely back in school; and we can get our economy back on track by helping hundreds of thousands of small businesses open and stay open; and that we can give people of this nation a fighting chance again with relief checks, lower childcare costs, lower healthcare costs, and so much more.  That’s our job.  That’s our responsibility.  And in the process, we’ll be growing the economy as well.  We’re going to have to stay on top of every dollar spent through the American Rescue Plan.  And that’s what we’re going to do.  We can do this.  We will do this.  God bless you all.  Help us on the way.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you very, very much.  Q    Should President Donald Trump help promote the vaccine among skeptics, sir, especially those Republicans who say they’re not willing to take it? THE PRESIDENT:  I’m hearing a lot of reports from serious reporters like you saying that.  I discussed it with my team, and they say the thing that has more impact than anything Trump would say to the MAGA folks is what the local doctor, what the local preachers, what the local people in the community say.  So I urge — I urge all local docs and — and ministers and priests and every — to talk about why — why it’s important to get it — to get that vaccine, and even after that, until everyone is in fact vaccinated, to wear this mask.  Thank you very much.  Thank you. 2:12 P.M. EDT We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

EST THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Thank you, Kamala.  You know, when I look out over what happened the last 50 days when Jill and I first got a chance to move into this magnificent building behind you, I promised the American people — and I guess this is becoming an overused phrase — that help was on the way. But today, with the American Rescue Plan now signed into law, we’ve delivered on that promise.  And I don’t mean I’ve delivered; we’ve delivered.  Look out there on all of you.  Patty, there would still be people, kids in poverty, were it not for all the work you did all those years. And I want to say to Bernie: Bernie, stepping up and making the case why this was so transformational made a big difference in how a lot of people voted. I look out at all of you, House members as well, who have made the case to the American people why this is so important.  I watched my buddy, Jim, down in South Carolina, stand up and talk about how it’s going to affect individual people. I haven’t — my inclination is to mention every single one of you, because I think I’ve called most of you and thanked you already for what you did.  I even called Pallone.  He wasn’t there, though; he was on the other side of the river.  We joke all the time.  He’s in — he’s in New Jersey; I’m in Delaware.  I keep reminding him Delaware owns the Delaware River up to the high watermark in New Jersey.  (Laughter.)But all kidding aside, I want to thank you all.  I want to thank, particularly, the Speaker, who, from day one — from the very first day I got the nomination — was supportive in ways that are hard for me to describe. And, you know, I served a long time in the United States Senate, longer than anybody for — still there at the time, other than Pat.  If I were still in the Senate, I’d be Senate pro tem because I was two years ahead of Pat.  (Laughter.)But all kidding aside, we’ve still got a lot of great majority leaders.  But I never saw anybody handle such a controversial, consequential piece of legislation that was right on the edge than Chuck Schumer.  I owe you, Chuck.  You did an incredible job.  (Applause.)And look — and to the members of the House and Senate, thanks for making this happen.  You made it happen.  As I said, I served 36 years in the Senate.  I know how hard it is to pass major consequential legislation, particularly when we only have such minor, small majorities in both houses, Steny.  You’ve done an incredible job. And, Nancy and Chuck, I have to say that I agree with many of the columnists that have commented on this legislation: What you shepherded through the Congress not only meets the moment, it does even more.  It’s historical, and they call it transformational.  And it really is.  The bill was supported overwhelmingly by the American people — Democrats, independents, and Republicans — and had a strong support of governors and mayors across the country in both parties — red states and blues.  Over 430 mayors contacted me, many of them Republicans, supporting the bill. And here’s why: Because what you all did with it and the refinements you made, it directly addressed the emergency in this country because it focuses on what people need most. Debbie and I often talked about: You got to tell people in plain, simple, straightforward language what it is you’re doing to help.  You have to be able to tell a story, tell the story of what you’re about to do and why it matters because it’s going to make a difference in the lives of millions of people and in very concrete, specific ways. This leg- — this legislation, as everybody has already mentioned, will provide $1,400 in direct payments, which we all promised.  Well, that means for a typical family of four — a middle-class family, husband and wife working, making $110,000 a year — that means a $5,600 check they’re going to get.  Eighty-five percent of the households in America will be getting this money.  (Applause.)Now, a lot of you know — because of the way you came up like I did and others — what that can mean.  Think of the millions of people going to sleep at night, staring at the ceiling, thinking, “My god, what am I going to do tomorrow?  I’ve lost my healthcare.  I don’t have a job.  Unemployment runs out.  I’m behind on my mortgage.  What are we going to do?”  Well, guess what?  They’re going to be getting that check soon, either by direct deposit or a check from the Treasury. And they’re going to — some are going to get it as early as this weekend.  This legislation provides resources needed to open our schools.  How many of you have dealt not only in your own home and with your children and grandchildren, if you have them, with how difficult it is, the mental pressure and stress that are on so many families?  So many people needing — need — needing help — if they had access to counseling — because it’s caused an enormous, enormous stress. This legislation extends unemployment insurance by $300 a week until September.  It’s going to help 11 million Americans who were days from losing that benefit.  This legislation includes the biggest investment in childcare since World War Two.  That’s not hyperbole; that’s just a fact.  It’s a fact. It provides help for small businesses to stay open.  And, you know, four hundred thou- — so many have had to close because, the first time around, you all worked and did a great piece of work, and the House passed a significant legislation.  What’s the first thing the last President — he fired — he fired the folks who were supposed to watch and make sure it got, in fact, distributed the way it was supposed to.  We find out so much of it went to people who didn’t need it.  You all took care of that. It extends coverage and lowers healthcare costs for so many Americans.  So many Americans.  And it’s a big number for people. It provides for food and nutrition.  Because people knew — and you all were out there handing out food like many of us were, but you saw people who were in car lines that were literally miles long.  You’d see four lanes of cars that went back for a half a mile each, just to get a box of food.  Again, through no fault of their own. It’s going to help people keep a roof over their heads.  A half million are — haven’t been able to make their — their mortgage payments, about to be thrown out of their apartments.  They have to make up all that they owe.  And those mom-and-pop realtors are in real trouble. It’s going to cut job poverty in half with — with — and, you know, I’ve talked to so many of you.  Rosa, you and I’ve spent so much time on this.  But you guys — you, Patty, and others — are the ones that have been leading this for so long, and it’s finally coming to fruition.  And the American people understand it. It pays for many of the steps we’ve taken on — to vaccinate Americans.  We’re going to be in a position where, because of what you all did in the past, we had the money to go out and literally purchase hundreds of millions of vaccines, and then go out and make sure we had enough vaccinators.  Vaccine is one thing.  To get the vaccine in a vial, out of that vial and into a needle, and a needle into someone’s arm — it took tens of thousands of people. And because of you, we were able to mobilize the military.  We were able to mobilize FEMA.  We were able — I was able, by executive order, to allow former docs and nurses to come back and be able to engage in this activity.And one of the things that we said in the beginning that no one thought that I was being straight about was I said: This is going to create — we — we have to spend this money to make sure we have economic growth, unrelated to how much it’s going to help people.  Well, guess what?  Every single major economist out there — left, right, and center — supported this plan.  Even Wall Street agreed.  According to Moody’s, for example, by the end of this year, this law alone will create 7 million new jobs.  (Applause.)  Seven million.And the bill does one more thing, which I think is really important: It changes the paradigm.  For the first time in a long time, this bill puts working people in this nation first.  It’s not hyperbole; it’s a fact.  (Applause.)   For too long, it’s been the folks at the top.  They’re not bad folks.  A significant number of them know they shouldn’t be getting the tax breaks they had.  But it put the richest Americans first, who benefited the most.  And the theory was — we’ve all heard it, and especially the last 15 years.  The theory was: Cut taxes, and those at the top and the benefits they get will trickle down to everyone.  Well, you saw what trickle down does.  We’ve known it for a long time.  But this is the first time we’ve been able to, since the Johnson administration and maybe even before that, to begin to change the paradigm. We’ve seen time and time again that that trickle down does not work.  And, by the way, we don’t have anything against wealthy people.  You got a great idea, you’re going to go out and make millions of dollars — that’s fine.  I have no problem with that.  But guess what?  You got to pay your fair share.  You got to pay some.  Because guess what?  Folks who are making — living on the edge, they’re paying.  And so, again, all it’s done is make those at the top richer in the past, and everyone else falling behind. This time, it’s time that we build an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out — (applause) — the middle out.  And this bill shows that when you do that, everybody does better.  The wealthy do better.  Everybody does better across the board. If that’s our foundation, then everything we build upon will be strong — a strong foundation: our competitiveness around the world, the jobs here at home, the health and quality of our lives.  That’s what the American Rescue Plan represents, and it’s all about rebuilding what I’ve been saying, and Bernie and a lot of others are saying — the backbone of this country.  The backbone of this country are hardworking folks.  Hardworking folks.  Middle-class folks.  People who built the country.  And I might add, I think, unions built the middle class.  And it’s about creating opportunity and giving people a fair shot.  That’s really all and everything it’s about. In the coming weeks, Jill and I, and Kamala and Doug, and our Cabinet, with all of you — members of Congress — we’re going to be traveling the country to speak directly to the American people about how this law is going to make a real difference in their lives and how help is here for them.  Almost every single aspect would be significant — would be every — if you took the piece of this bill and broke it into all of the pieces, every one of those pieces standing alone would be viewed as a significant accomplishment.  But it’s all the work you’ve done for years to try to get us there. This law is not the end of our efforts, though.  I view it as only the beginning.  As we — look, one of the things that I’ve been most worried about, and I think you all have too — especially those of us who’ve been around for 100 years, like me — is you’ve watched people lose confidence in government.  Just lose confidence in that we tell the truth. That’s why, when I announced, I — I quoted Franklin Roosevelt.  He said, “I’ll give it to you straight from the shoulder.”  The American people can handle anything if you tell them the truth.  And they really can.  Just give it straight from the shoulder.  (Applause.)  And when we do something right, we’re going to make a case for it.  And when I make a mistake, I’m going to own up to it and say, “It was me.  I made a mistake.” And I said last night: This is not over.  Conditions can change.  We’re not finished yet.  Conditions can change.  The scientists have warned us about new variants of this virus.  And the devil is in the details of implementing this legislation. I know from experience when the President turned to me — like I haven’t done to the Vice President yet — and said, “Take care of it.  You take care of implementing the plan.”  But she could do it.  But I remember being — given the dubious distinction of having to implement a Recovery Act back in — when we came into office, Barack and I.  I spent literally four or five hours a day, for six months.  I talked to over 160 mayors probably more than two or three times; every governor, save one, who was looking at from Alaska to Russia — and making sure that we’re in a situation where we talk to everybody.  But it takes — the devil is in the details. It’s one thing to pass the American Rescue Plan.  It’s going to be another thing to implement it.  It’s going to require fastidious oversight to make sure there’s no waste or fraud, and the law does what it’s designed to do.  And I mean it: We have to get this right.  Details matter, because we have to continue to build confidence in the American people that their government can function for them and deliver. So there’s a lot of work for all of us left to do, but I know we’ll do it.To every American watching: Help is here, and we will not stop working for you.  Together, with you, we are showing it’s possible to get big, important things done.  That’s what America does.  It tackles hard problems.  And how we do — you know, look, it’s how we do have it within ourselves to come out of this moment, which we’ve been saying — a lot of us have been saying for a long time, more prosperous, more united, and stronger than we went in.  That’s where we have a chance to be.  That’s what we’re going to be able to do. And it’s really critical — and it’s really critical to demonstrate not Democrat/Republican; it’s critical to demonstrate that government can function — can function and deliver prosperity, security, and opportunity for the people in this country. And as my grandfather used to kiddingly say, “With the grace of God, the goodwill of the neighbors, and the crick not rising,” that’s exactly what we’re going to do. God bless you all.  Thanks for all you did.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you.  (Applause.) I wish I could come out and shake hands with every one of you.  But next time, it won’t be so far apart.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  (Applause.)  3:00 P.M. EST We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

							 State Dining Room 8:32 A.M. EST PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Hello, everyone.  I wish we were able to do this in person, but it’s wonderful to gather with friends even — even in this virtual format.  We’re reminded that we’re in the midst of a global crisis, but we’re going to overcome that as well.  The Quad group is — was created in the wake of, as you just — everyone just saw on that short film — in the wake of a crisis under my predecessor, George W. Bush, on
